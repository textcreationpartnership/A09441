            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7.51.</note> (ſtanding in our Lords defence)
<hi>Doth our Law judge any man, before it heare him, and know what hee

haſt before this time, peruſed <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Pagets</hi> Booke, and haſt there
ſeene many words tending to his owne juſtification, and our condemnation.
Now the thing that I ſhall deſireouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly requeſt of thee, is, that thou
wilt haue the patience, to read over this my Anſwer to it: And when thou
haſt ſeriouſly ſtudied, pondered and examined, by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring rule of
Gods Word, all that both parties haue ſaid in the whole caraige of this
buſines; judge then, as God ſhall give thee underſtanding. Wiſhing thee
by the way to remember, what folly and ſhame it is for any, (as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon<note n="*" place="margin">

            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:24844:3"/>
            <p>There are ſome things, which I thinke neceſſary firſt of
all, to informe thee off; and that is touching the <hi>reaſons,</hi> why I
haue ſet forth this Treatiſe: Alſo, why in the manner it is.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, to let paſſe the many <hi>inſultations</hi>
and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations,</hi> which I haue ſuffred at ſome particular mens
handes, ſince his writing came forth, as if every thing were true that he
hath ſet downe againſt me. I am ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by name particularly called upon, and
ſingled out to defend our <hi>Iuſt Complaint</hi> made againſt him.
Beſides accuſed of committing many <hi>untruths, ſlaunders, lies,</hi>
with other crimes, little leſſe then blaſphemy: and this not againſt
himſelf alone, but Magiſtrates, Miniſters, yea all Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches. If
I ſhould therefore under theſe heavie charges, ſay nothing; would not
moſt men hence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that I am guiltie. And ſo through my ſilence, I
ſhould (which I dare not doe) diſhonour God, betray the truth, and let goe
my owne innocency.</p>
            <p>Moreover I conceive that it lay upon me (though the meaneſt of
my Brethren) to reply; conſidering that the <hi>Booke of Complaints</hi> was
ſet forth chiefly by my meanes. Now my conſcience for my part beares me
witnes, that I did the thing, out of love towards God, his truth and people;
and not (as is falſely ſuggeſted) of contention and a peeuiſh mind. And
I was thereto moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the ſooner; 1. becauſe the ſame was in many mens
hands already, and ſo rather publicke then private. 2. We had waited almoſt
a quarter of a yeare for anſwer, but could not obtaine it, although <hi>M<hi rend="sub">r</hi>.
Paget</hi> was ſpoken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, many times about it. 3. It was given out, that
hee had writen 12 or 15 ſheets of paper againſt us, and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſhortly
to acquaint the world therewith: when this report was brought unto me, I
thought it requiſite (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <pb facs="tcp:24844:3"/>the copies by me) immediately to
publiſh them: that ſo (ſeeing hee would publikely write in confutation
thereof) men might truely underſtand, what our parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular grieveances were.
And theſe cauſes of great and good regard, led me to doe, what I did. Of
which more is ſpoken in another place. Laſtly whereas I haue had
occaſion, to ſit many times in our <hi>Conſistory.</hi> Hence I haue
taken a more full and certaine knowledge of our common <hi>Eccleſiasticall
affaires.</hi> I mean, obſerved the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freenes of our Congregation, and her
ſubjection to the power of the <hi>Claſsis,</hi> and in this regard, as I
know my ſelf, the better able to give teſtimony of the truth in the
mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters betwixt us: ſo I thinke my ſelf the more called to ſpeake what I
truely may, in the juſt defence of my ſelf and others.</p>
            <p>For the manner of this writing: Whoſoever ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
either the ſubject here treated off; or the perſons whom it chiefly
reſpecteth, will (I thinke) confeſſe, that there lay a neceſſity upon
mee, to uſe the beſt meanes I could, to haue it done unto ſome effectuall
purpoſe.</p>
            <p>But for my part, I muſt confeſſe, (and ſo I would haue all
men, in all places to know) that I am not in my ſelf of the abilitie, to
compoſe a worke of this nature. And therefore thorow my entreatie and
deſire, others (more able) haue taken ſome paines for me herein: both in
ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out learned Authours, as alſo ſetting them downe in the places
as they ſtand: On whoſe fidelity, ſkill and care I haue preſumed the
publiſhing of them to the world: having this confidence in the
<hi>perſon,</hi> or <hi>perſons,</hi> that they will ſtand to juſtify
all the allegations, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the end and uſe here produced. And if
juſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion be offered, it may be they will adde ſome thing more
thereunto.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:24844:4"/>
            <p>As for the truth of the matter, this <hi>I owne</hi> under my owne
hand. And to uſe here <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Pagets</hi> words, <hi>for the teſtimony of
this truth, I am not aſhamed to ſuffer that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, which ſome lay
upon me. Though I have allready bene ſmiten on the right checke,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Preface.</note> 
               <hi>yet I am ready to turne the other alſo,
rather then to forſake this truth, which I iudge to be of great importance.
Yea if I were cast upon my death-bed, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to deliver up my ſoule in the
hands of the Lord, I ſhould among my laſt words, profeſſe before men
and Angels, that the things here pleaded for by me, are the holy precepts of
the eternall God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reaſon why I haue not followed him, ſteppe by ſteppe
throughout his Booke, but haue principally inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted upon two points, viz.
<hi>promiſcuous Baptiſme,</hi> and the <hi>due power of the Church,</hi>
is, becauſe on theſe depend all our differences: For if it be true (as it
is here prooved, to be moſt true) that it is unlawfull to baptiſe any
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, whoſe Parents (one at leaſt) are not members of any viſible
Church. And that every particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, is independent, and may, yea
ought to practiſe Eccleſiaſticall Government, and all other Gods
ſpiritual ordinances, in, and of it ſelf immediately from Chriſt: Then it
will follow, that our former <hi>protest</hi> is certainly true againſt him:
And ſo much (the premiſes granted) is by himſelf acknowledged; for thus
hee ſayth: <hi>If this Church be deprived of that liberty and power, which
Chriſt hath given it, &amp;c.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Preface.</note> 
               <hi>If
the Elders be deprived of their power in Government; for the good of the
Church: If I have ſubie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, the Church under the undue power of the
Claſsis, &amp;c. If theſe, and the like aſſertions in their Booke he
true, then is there cauſe to complaine of the miſerable ſlavery and
bondage of this Church, and of Tyrannicall government. Then is there cauſe,
to commend and preferre the liberty and freedome, if <pb facs="tcp:24844:4"/>the
Browniſts, which are not ſubject unto the power of any Claſsis or Synod,
&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not to trouble then the Reader, with unneceſſary
diſcourſes; I am well conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, in this to joyne iſſue with him, that
ſo all wiſe and judicious Readers, ſtudious of the truth, by this meanes,
may the ſooner perceive where the fault is, and cenſure it accordingly.</p>
            <p>Touching <hi>Mr. Pagets</hi> perſon, I hope all men ſhall
ſee, by the care which I haue had, to avoyd all bitternes, and unreverend
ſpeaches, (howbeit often provoked to it) that I beare no ill will againſt
him; truely I doe not: For the Lord is a witnnes to my conſcience, I ly not,
that I wiſh his good, many wayes, and ſhall be glad to heare that the Lord,
before his changing, doe give him repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for the evills, which hee hath
committed againſt the Congregation; and other good Servants of God.
Howſoever, my hope is, that his ſinne herein hath bene of ignorance, and
ſo God for his Sonnes ſake will pardon it to him.</p>
            <p>So for the Claſſis, they are men whom I much reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and
worſhip God with my ſoule, for the gifts and graces, which appeare in them:
Notwithſtanding for their aſſuming unto themſelves authority over our
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation: This my mind gives me, is their fayling, and it cannot by Gods
Word be juſtified. Beſides wee are a people of another Nation, whoſe
language they know not, at leaſt moſt of them; and therefore to me it
ſeemes ſtrange, that they ſhould undertake the care and charge of us;
being in this regard moſt unfit for it. I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, put aſide this
laſt age, there will not be found an example of the like practiſe anywhere,
ſince the Apoſtles dayes.</p>
            <p>To draw unto a concluſion, the thing that I chiefly <pb facs="tcp:24844:5"/>ayme at, is, that the Churches of God hereafter, may keepe &amp;
practiſe the ordinances of Ieſus Chriſt, and not under a pretence to haue
things better, then the <hi>Lords owne institutions,</hi> to give place unto
the ſinfull deviſes of men. Let us conſider Moyſes words: <hi>Ye
ſhall obſerve to doe as the Lord your God hath commaunded you:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 5.32.</note> 
               <hi>You ſhall not turne aſide, to the right
hand, or to the left.</hi> When worldly Princes make any ſtatutes; their
ſubjects are carefull ſtrictly to doe them, without putting thereto, ought
of their owne. How much more, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And as for any anſwer that ſhall be made unto this Treatiſe;
this I ſhall deſire in it, 1. that all by-matters be layd aſide, and the
truth followed in love, without gibes, reproaches, bitternes, &amp;c. things
unbeſeeming the Saints of God.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eſa.</hi> 8.20.</note>
2. That <hi>Scripture-proofes</hi> be brought, for the matters in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>troverſy
betwixt us. <hi>To the Law, and to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony. All Scripture</hi>
(ſaith Paul) <hi>is given by inſpiration of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2.
Ti. 3.16.</note> 
               <hi>and is profitable for doctrine, for reproofe, for
correction, for inſtruction in righteouſnes.</hi> 3. I doe wiſh that
whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhall be writen, may be done to the glory of God, as of
ſincerity, and for the truths ſake.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, I ſuppoſe, few will take it amiſſe, that I
haue now anſwered for my ſelf, conſidering how often he hath called upon

on his ſide,<note place="margin">Anſwer to the Preface.</note> and to thinke
his caſe right and good: hee ſeeketh in the Preface of his Booke, to
diſgrace exceedingly <hi>the publiſher of the juſt complaint, against his
unjust doings.</hi> And this hee doth two wayes: Firſt in affirming that
<hi>hee ſought helpe of the Browniſts.</hi> Secondly that hee is <hi>a
ſimple perſon, one of the least understanding among the
Subſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANSWER.</p>
               <p n="1">1. IT is untrue that I ſought any helpe of them: For I
never ſpake to any of them about the thing, but onely to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:24844:6"/>And it was nothing but this, viz. that hee ſhould make
<hi>a title Page anſwerable to the copy:</hi> whereas therefore hee
inſinuateth that the <hi>Browniſts were chief agents in the worke; and
encouraged me and others against him.</hi> This is not ſo: For to my
knowledge, not any of them, were made acquainted with the thing, untill I
brought it to the preſſe. And the reaſon why I made uſe of him, it was
not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his Religion, but becauſe hee was an Engliſh Printer, and
therefore the more fit (as I thought) to be imployed.</p>
               <p>But indeed <hi>a ſimple man</hi> may eaſily geſſe, for
what end, and uſe hee names theſe men; hee doth it (much like
<hi>Sanballats</hi> deviſe againſt <hi>Nehemiah</hi>) <hi>to have matter
for an evill report,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Neb.</hi> 6.13.</note> 
                  <hi>and
that hee might reproach me.</hi> Hee knew well, theſe people are hated of the
world, and ſpoken in many places badly off; and therefore doubted not, but
moſt men would give ſentence wholy on his ſide, when they ſhould heare
that his oppoſites <hi>ſought helpe of them.</hi> And that which I here
ſay, I ſay it on good ground; For whenſoever in his harſh and
paſſionate writing, hee goeth about (as often hee doth) to make us vile in
the eyes of all men, hee compares us with the <hi>Browniſts,</hi> not
prooving againſt us any ſinne, but concludeth wee doe evill, whenſoever
in any thing wee accord with them. Many inſtances I could give for proofe
hereof; as for example <hi>in pag. 6.</hi> ſeeking to diſcredit many of us,
about the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> hee tells us <hi>our plauſible ſpeaches
and pretences of reverence to it, are ſuch as the Browniſts will
ſay.</hi> So in another place, charging us with pretended reverence to the
<hi>Claſses</hi> and <hi>Synods.</hi> Hee ſaith <hi>the Browniſts
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves will ſeeme to give as much.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 84.</note> Againe to reproach ſome of the Brethren
for certaine exerciſes which they uſed privately in their families; wee are

                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 105.</note> VVhen wee complaine

Hee anſwereth that <hi>the ſame may be found in ſuch as Mr. Ainſworth,

Paget</hi> teacheth many things as they doe: therefore <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Paget</hi>
teacheth many untruths. If this argument will not paſſe in Schooles, then
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:24844:6"/>certainly a great part of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Pagets</hi> Booke, wants,
as truth, ſo art too.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For his reputing me to have the <hi>least understanding
among the complainants:</hi> I little eſteeme thereof; for indeed I know my
Talent this way is very ſmall, yet I prayſe God for it; and doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to improove the ſame unto his glory; and wiſh from my heart, that as
<hi>Mr. Paget</hi> hath received a greater meaſure of good gifts, ſo hee
would hereafter labour to put them to a better uſe; and not ſeeke by his
witt and learning, to diſcountenance the truth, and countenance errour, to
the diſhonour of Gods great Name, the generall grief of many good people, and
to the hardning of ſinners in their perverſe and crooked wayes.<note place="margin">

               </p>

                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.27 <hi>Act.</hi>

conſidering how the Lord many times <hi>chooſeth the fooliſh things of

controverſy may the better and ſooner be ended.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But if I am ſo ignorant, as hee reports me to be, how
came it then to paſſe, that hee and others made an <hi>Officer</hi> of me?
the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures forbid that one of the leaſt underſtanding ſhould be made

in not dehorting them from the action; by ſhewing unto them my great

thing of purpoſe againſt me, in hope by the diſabling of me, to honour
the more your ſelf, and your owne bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doings by it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Such as will impartially read your Booke, may plainly
perceive, that there is in you a very ill property: that is, in not-carying
your ſelf more meekely, and gently, towards him, whom you judge to be
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:24844:7"/>the weakeſt of many. <hi>Pauls</hi> practiſe was
otherwiſe, hee never ſhewed himſelf (that wee can read) froward, violent
and bitter in ſpeaches unto <hi>weake and ſimple men.</hi> It was not his
manner to gibe,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.29. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi>
2.24.25. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1.</note> ſcoffe and gird at
them, and to publiſh abroad unto others their infirmities, of ſet purpoſe
to exaſperate them, and to make them contemptible. The more infirme any

you <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get</hi> dealt ſo with me? (ſpeake out.) You ſay, <hi>I
am ſimple;</hi> I pray what meanes have you uſed to make me wiſer? Have
you hitherto taken any particular courſe for my bettering? Saveing of late
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, you have ſent forth into the world many untruths againſt mee. If
your ſimple and weake people ſhall find ſuch hard dealing at your hands,
what may be ſtronger and wiſer exſpect. Well may I ſay in another mans

               </p>
               <p n="6">6. If <hi>Mr. Paget</hi> dare take my teſtimony, I doe
aſſure him, there are many that wonder at his great overſight; how hee
could without bluſhing, mention the <hi>Browniſts</hi> in this thing; as
thinking to advantage his caſe any way by it. Conſidering what <hi>a chief
agent</hi> hee hath bene unto ſome, which were ſome times of them: not

enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes;</hi> but to gather up himſelf, all the perſonall fayling
which hee could find out among them, and afterwards under other mens names, to
publiſh it in print, whereby to make them odious. Oh me thinkes ſeeing hee
knew himſelf faulty this way, hee ſhould have bene therewith ſo deepely
affected, as (in the words of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other) ſaid; <hi>As I have done, ſo hath
God requited me.</hi> Indeed wee read in Scripture,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iudg.</hi> 1.7.</note> that the Lord many times puniſheth

But I perceive <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Paget</hi> lookes upon others, otherwiſe then on
himſelf, and thinkes his neighbours may not take the liberty, to returne that
backe unto him, which hee ſends abroad.</p>
               <p>But to leave him in the midſt of his owne thoughts; I doe
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire thee (good Reader) to take notice, how greatly hee hath abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
thee, and many others, by a falſe report, in ſaying that the
<hi>Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts were ſpeciall Actours in the worke, chief agents, ſetters
of us at worke, encouragers of us againſt him.</hi> Whereas (I ſpeake it in
all good conſcience) that not one of them, to my knowledge, did ever
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:24844:7"/>meddle with our matters, or helped us at any time, either by
word or writing. Indeed when I brought the copies to the preſſe, I
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated the Printer (as I ſaid before) to ſet it out in a good order,
and no other aſſiſtance was there ſought, either from him, or any other
of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Paget</hi> promiſeth his Readers in the firſt page
of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, <hi>to give ſome light unto them, for the better decerning
and jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the differences between us.</hi> Now truely if this be his
beſt light, I hope the Godly wiſe will take heed how to follow it. For in
truth the <hi>light</hi> which hee here ſets up, is much like unto a falſe
latterne, which ill diſpoſed people hang out on ſome cleft or high place,
of purpoſe to cauſe the Mariners to miſſe the haven, and to runne their
Veſſells on the rocks. Much better therefore hee had done, if hee had
followed the Apoſtles precept; that is,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Not have put a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling blocke, or an occaſion to fall

alſo. But ſaith hee, <hi>I am not convinced of my errour.</hi> So may any
offendor ſay, although his lies and vanities ſhould be never ſo ſoundly
refuted. It is reported of one <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> that hee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, that

againſt him, but they could not ſatisfy him, nor ſolve his reaſon. If

conſcience of the unlawfullnes of the thing. Moreover hee ſhould have done
well, to have told his Readers, what my anſwer was at the ſame time unto
him. I ſpake (as hee knowes) to this effect: <hi>If I goe astroy, it is

great, that my ſpirits is even broken within me: For your caraiges are ſo
evill againſt us, in ſeeking to hinder us from the benefit of good
Miniſters, that I cannot live under yours with any comfort.</hi> What reliefe
my poore diſtreſſed ſoule then had of him, I ſhall never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get: For
I may ſay (and that truely) as <hi>Iob</hi> did in the like caſe; hee was

                     <hi>Iob</hi> 16.2.5.</note> The mooving of his lips was ſo farre
from aſſwaging my grief, that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, hee heaped up words
againſt me to encreaſe mine affliction. In the reading of this
accuſation, it comes to my mind, what I have ſometimes ſeene in the
Country where I lived, viz. many poore ſheepe, even forced to runne into
deſerts, hedges, briars, through the impatience &amp; rage of ſome feirce
&amp; froward Shepheards; either in ſetting their dogs on them, or running in

farre as I can underſtand, hee is quite dumbe this way, and ſtirres not at
all in it, and therefore it is certaine, that that which hee here brings in
againſt me, is either done out of ſome diſaffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction unto my perſon, or
els hee ſhewes great impartiality, to ſay the beſt of it. But it ſeemes
hee is not carefull to have his miniſtery like <hi>a glaſse,</hi> in which
all may behold their ſports; but rather to the <hi>ſpiders web,</hi> which
holdeth the leſſer Flyes, but lets the greater paſſe through at their
pleaſure. And here I may well returne backe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him,<note place="margin">Arrow againſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par. pag. <hi>323.</hi> liu.

there is in your courſe.</hi> Thus hee can take occaſion to blame another:
and yet fall fouler himſelf into the ſame fault.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whereas hee intimateth that hee in the name of the
<hi>Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip hath admoniſhed me for the open violation of the
Sabbath.</hi> I deſire the Reader to take knowledge, that no ſuch thing was
ever done by him; neither did I know, that either hee, or the <hi>Elders,</hi>
had any ſuch thing againſt me, till I ſaw the accuſation out in print.
And what I here ſay, <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Paget</hi> knowes it to be true, although with
his pen hee hath writen otherwiſe. Hee complains againſt <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.
Davenport</hi> in pag. 42. <hi>for want of ſincere and plaine dealing.</hi>
And why? becauſe the other <hi>without his knowledge did write his
words.</hi> But what cauſe have I to complaine againſt him, <hi>for want of
plaine and ſincere dealing,</hi> for publiſhing againſt me many
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths. Notwithſtanding I will not bid him, as hee doth me, <hi>to awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

                  </gap>ee will never be able to doe

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:24844:9"/>Reader) thou mayeſt ſee, how farre hee is from taking
good wayes to reſtore me, if I am fallen, as on the contrary hee ſeekes by
blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting my name, to keepe me onward ſtill in an uneven walking. But to
anſwer him directly; if <hi>Mr. Paget</hi> had bene as foreward, to have made
inquirie for the truth of the thing, as too foreward to publiſh an untruth
about it, hee ſhould have heard with his eares, and ſeene with his eyes,
that I am ſo farre from offending this way, that my care and labour to the
contrary hath bene an occaſion of ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in my familie as alſo
of many jeſts and reproaches from my neighbours about me. And here let it
againe be obſerved, the great partiality of this man: hee taxeth me for
<hi>Sabbath breaking</hi> Now if hee thinke, as hee ſpeaketh, that it is a
ſinne <hi>to buy and ſell on that day.</hi> Oh how negligent then is hee in
the worke of the Lord, in not being more <hi>Z alouſly earnest,</hi> to have
the ſame reformed. Hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly be ignorant, that under his
<hi>Eccleſiaſticall Gouvernment</hi> (as hee takes it) there are many
ſcoores, conſtantly breakers of the day; I ſay many wayes:
notwithſtanding hee ſuffereth them alone, and never admoniſheth them
thereof. But how hee will be able to anſwer this unto God, let hee himſelf
looke well to it. It may be hee thinkes to helpe himſelf with that deviſe,
which hee talkes off in <hi>pag. 97.</hi> viz. a <hi>quarter watching;</hi> but
for my part I verily thinke, that the Lord will require a ſtrict account<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Matt.</hi> 25.24.</note> of him, for every ſoule,

that the Lord will puniſh him, for his preſumption and omiſſion

               <p>Laſtly whereas hee addes the word, <hi>open,</hi> to have the

much like ſuch a <hi>gunner,</hi> ſeeking at one ſhott to ſhute all
terrible bullets into my ſids. But I ſhall endeavour (the Lord
aſſiſting me) to avoyd them all, by making it cleere and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent (to
every indifferent Reader) that I am not <hi>injurious</hi> in any one of the
particulars, wherewith hee moſt injuriouſly accuſeth me.</p>
               <p>Firſt hee ſayth, <hi>I am iniurious to</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport
<hi>in printing that which hee wrote without his conſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANSWER.</p>
               <p n="1">1. HOwſoever <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> knew not of it, yet
for ought I knew hee was not unwilling to have it publiſhed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though hee wrote it, yet the matter jointly concerned
us all; therefore it was neceſſary (as I thought) that it ſhould not ly
hid in the hands of a few men; ſeeing (moſt probably) by the publiſhing
of it, God would be glorified, the truth cleared, errour confuted, and many
good Chriſtians comforted.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Howſoever <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Paget</hi> here finds fault with
me; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ſame thing hath bene ſometime his owne
practiſe. I pray, who gave him leave to ſet forth <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Ainſworth</hi>
writings; or what conſent had hee of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Robinſon,</hi> when hee
printed certain letters of his, ſent privately to <hi>D. Ames.</hi> I doe not
mention his doings, to juſtifie my owne thereby; but onely to ſhew his
great partialty, in judging that to be evill in another, which himſelf
notwithſtanding is moſt forward to doe. Is not Pauls ſaying here worthy
of remembrance,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.21.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou which
teachest another, teachest thou not thy ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond injury which I have done is <hi>to ſome of my
fellow-complaynanss, who profeſſe themſelves</hi> (as hee ſaith)
<hi>highly offended at the printing thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. If they be offended, the queſtion is, whether it be
not an offence taken, but none given. As for <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Paget,</hi> hee hath not
yet <pb n="11" facs="tcp:24844:10"/>prooved (nor I thinke ever will) that I have
tranſgreſſed in it; and therefore hee begs onely the queſtion, not
being able to bring any word of God to convince me of ſinne: for ſuppoſe
I ſhould here reaſon thus; If ſome of my fellow complaynants, doe
profeſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be highly offended with <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Paget,</hi> for
his bad caraiges, unchriſtian ſpeaches, and divers great abuſes offered
unto many good men: Then hath <hi>Mr. Paget</hi> bene injurious unto them. But
ſome of my fellow complaynants doe profeſſe thus: Therefore &amp;c. Now
let me ſee what defence hee can make for himſelf, which will not ſerve to
cleare me every way as well.</p>
               <p>A third pretended injury is, becauſe <hi>a Brownist did print
it, with a ſchiſmaticall addition in the end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. I doe deny that <hi>addition</hi> to be
ſchiſmaticall; but contrary wiſe holy and good, even a duety commaunded
in Scripture, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed in the beſt and pureſt Churches, juſtifyed by
the moſt judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Divines, ancient and moderne; as I ſhall hereafter
largely proove. But no marvaill that <hi>M<hi rend="sub">r</hi>. Paget</hi> is offended at it,
ſeeing the Godly are there encouraged to ſtand faſt in that freedome and
liberty, which Chriſt hath purchaſed for them with his owne blood. This hee
cannot indure; this hee cannot read with patience; againſt this hee proclames
open warre, gibes often at it, and reproacheth every one that ſincerely
embraceth the ſame. But let him take heed, leaſt for calling <hi>good,
evill;</hi>

               <p>As for the unreverend terme it ſelf, which hee giveth unto
<hi>Christs instuution:</hi> we weigh it not, neither are we any more
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, from the holding of it faſt, then were our fathers of el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

<hi>ſchiſme, faction, foliſhnes, hereſie,</hi> &amp;c. It is reported
of one <hi>Theodotius,</hi> having denyed <hi>Christ,</hi> that hee might not
be blamed for it, taught that Chriſt was meere man and not God: So <hi>Mr.
Paget</hi> in the caſe of <hi>Church gouvernment,</hi> that his owne and
other mens faults may not be ſeene, in not uſing or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to it,
doth labour what hee can to diſcredit the ſame. But whether the
<hi>power</hi> which wee ſtand for, be <hi>ſchiſmaticall,</hi> or his
<hi>Apoſtaticall,</hi> I hope by this Treatiſe, the Reader ſhall be able
to judge.</p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:24844:11"/>
               <p n="4">4. Hee ſaith, I have bene injurious unto him, <hi>in

untruths againſt him, as are before noted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. 1. I had a juſt cauſe to doe, what I did; both for
the truth ſake, and his owne too: For firſt if every good ſubject be
bound (to his power to maintaine the temporall <hi>rights</hi> and
<hi>Lawes</hi> of Princes, whether it be by diſcovering of treaſon,
ſuppreſſing rebellion, or the like: Then much more ought all
<hi>Chriſts ſubjects</hi> to doe what they can,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.25.</note> to preſerve the good eſtate of his
ſpirituall Kingdome. Againe, who will not draw his brother out of a deepe pit
or well, if hee ſee any way or meanes for it. The truth is, <hi>Mr.
Paget</hi> through Satan and his owne luſt, is fallen into many great
ſinnes; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore out of Chriſtian compaſſion to his ſoule, I
publiſhed the booke; being confident, if there be any farther courſe, to be
taken by me for his recovery, this is it; becauſe now (queſtionles) hee
ſhall ſee (if hee will be contended to open his eyes) his errours ſoundly
and effectually refuted.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whereas hee ſaith our writings are <hi>untruths.</hi>
I ſay hee ſpeakes untruely in it; for there is nothing ſet downe there,
but will be prooved; as in part I ſhall doe in this treatiſe; and more, I
underſtand, is ſhortly to come forth. Beſides I doubt not, but <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.
Davenport</hi> will doe the like, ſo farre as the thing concerneth him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Howſoever hee hath made a large diſcours, in his
owne juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, notwithſtanding hee hath not cleared himſelf at all,
in the maine things laid to his charge, viz. <hi>promiſcuous Baptiſme,</hi>
and the <hi>authority of the Claſſis.</hi> Yet hee knowes untill hee proove
theſe two points to be lawfull, our whole writing ſtandeth firmely, and

Howſoever they thought it, yet abſolutely ſo to conclude, was beyond

that the opinions held by <hi>Mr. Hooker</hi> (howbeit condemned by the

juſtifiable by the word of God, it ſhall be manifeſted hereafter. In the

wherewith hee thinkes to affright us; and thus it may be laid downe. Such
perſons whom the Claſſicall Aſſembly and the Deputies of the Synod,
ſhall judge unfit to be admitted to the Miniſtery of the Engliſh Church
at Amſterdam, they may not be admitted: But ſo they judged <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.
Hooker;</hi> Therefore, &amp;c. To anſwer this argument; I reaſon thus. If

<hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Hooker</hi> fit, to be admitted to the Engliſh Church at

Therefore the ſecond. <hi>Had M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Paget bene wiſe &amp; conſiderate, hee
would rather have ſought to bury the memorie of theſe things, then by his

               <p>But let it be granted for reaſoning ſake, that the truth is
on their ſide, notwithſtanding I cannot ſee, how they can lawfully
require us to demit our ſelves to their Acts and ſentences, till they doe
lay downe, as their decrees, ſo the word of God, for the confirmation of
them; ſpecially in points knowne unto them to be much doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:24844:15"/>of and queſtioned, both by our <hi>Elders</hi> and many
more. Wee are men that doe profeſſe Religion, and deſire to doe Gods

thoſe, which take upon them to be our Guides and Teachers, will injoyne us to
leave this thing, or doe that; and yet bring us nothing from the Scriptures to

<hi>There is that ſpeaketh like the peircing of a ſword. And the words of a

this agreeth with Mr. <hi>Paget,</hi> may be ſeene in this particular, to
wit, in ſeeking to provoake the Magiſtrates againſt us. Truely his
dealing this way is moſt cruell; for in pag. 29.30. hee perverteth our words,
and ſeekes to make ſuch concluſions from them, as tend to our undoing
many wayes; as if wee ſhould count the Magiſtrates <hi>Tyrants,

               </p>
               <p>Now for anſwer to it: 1. So long as I have bene in theſe
Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, my care hath bene to walke dutifully toward <hi>the Higher
Powers;</hi> not willing at any time, to thinke of them, looke on them,
ſpeake of them, or to them; but with much reverence. For ſure I am, their
authority is from God; and therefore I have, and ſtill doe,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:24844:15"/>make conſcience to obey their Lawes, pay them tribute,
pray for them, and give God thankes for them,<note place="margin">

               <p n="2">2. I am ſo farre from having the thoughts which hee

Lawes eſtabliſhed, good men cheriſhed, evill-doers puniſhed, and the
poore comfortably provided for; by which meanes wee lead a quiet and peaceable

               <p n="3">3. I marvaill by what rule Mr. <hi>Paget</hi> went, when

generally thought (of the godly wiſe) that hee followed the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill of
ſome reaſonles paſſion, then any commendable plat-forme of art and
ſcience. But I pray (Sir) are you in good earneſt, that a man cannot
<hi>abuſe his interest in the Magiſtrates,</hi> as wee ſaid and meant,
but it muſt follow neceſſarily, that they are <hi>Tyrants,
Church-robbers,</hi> &amp;c. this you ſay: But I deny that any ſuch thing
can be rightly gathered from the place. For 1. wee never thought, nor can
thinke, that the Magiſtrates <hi>deprive us of that liberty and power, which
Christ hath given to his Church;</hi> becauſe wee know that they doe not take
upon them to elect and ordaine Miniſters, but give approbation unto ſuch as
by the Elders and people ſhall be choſen. 2. Our words have nothing in
them, tending that way, whereto you ſtretch them; wee ſay (and this is the
moſt) that <hi>the Magiſtrates will have us to take one that can ſpeake
Dutch, and one in this Countrie:</hi> Now may not they require ſo much, and
wee doe it; and yet wee keepe ſtill our power. If <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Paget</hi> had but
read our words charitably, hee ſhould haue ſeene that which hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth
from them, to be directly in them contradicted: For marke, all Readers that
haue ſence, wee ſay <hi>the Magiſtrates will have us to take one,
&amp;c.</hi> doth it not then follow, that wee confeſſe they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit us
<hi>to uſe the libertie and power which Christ hath given us,</hi> yea
encourage us to it: yet ſo, as wee chuſe a man to their liking. For
concluſion then. I ſhall exſpect in his next Booke, that hee either blot
out this ſlaunder, or make acknowledgement of his fault here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and to
induce him the more unto it: I wiſh him to read the Wiſe-mans ſaying:
<hi>Deviſe not evill against thy Neighbour,</hi>

dwelleth ſecurelie by thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly let it be noted, how unprofitable hee is unto the
<hi>peace of this Citie,</hi> in that hee ſeeketh by untrue reports, to ſet
debate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene the Rulers and people. The Scripture ſaith, <hi>In the
multitude of people is the Kings honour.</hi> As it is a fathers glory to haue
a large poſterity; a ſhepheards prayſe a great flock: ſo it is a
Gouvernours dignity and credit, to exerciſe authority over many faithfull
ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. But certain it is, <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Paget</hi> hath bene an occaſion,
not onely to drive ſome families hence, but alſo a principall hinderer of
many (and thoſe very rich in the world) from coming hither: the which thing
tendeth unto the great hurt, both of Church and Common-wealth; and what I here
ſpeake, I can make it good by many faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and honeſt witneſſes.</p>
               <p>The 8 injury <hi>is to all the Reformed Churches, in
publiſhing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints against ſuch lawfull authoritie, as is exerciſed
by them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. 1. VVhen <hi>M. Paget</hi> by the Scriptures hath
prooved the matters in controverſy betweene us lawfull; viz. the <hi>power of
the Claſſis,</hi> and his <hi>riffrafe Baptiſme;</hi> then I will (by
Gods grace) acknowledge my fault herein; till then, I ſhall alwayes
profeſſe, that hee hath <hi>borne falſe witneſſe against his
neighbour:</hi> A thing in his writings too common with him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Obſerve here, how <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Paget</hi> profeſſeth
plain Browniſme, and condemneth the Church of England, and that hee doth
ſo; I proove it thus: <hi>All Reformed Churches uſe a Claſſicall
gouvernment;</hi> (ſo ſaith hee) <hi>But the Engliſh Church uſeth no
ſuch: Therefore it is no Reformed Church, and ſo conſequentlie
falſe.</hi> VVhat Apologie hee can make, to vindicate his reputation, I yet
know not; but it may be wee ſhall ſee ſomething of it in his next
booke.</p>
               <p>The 9 injury that hee taxeth me with, <hi>is to all that ſeeke
Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and deſire the ſame Diſcipline, that is practiſed in
theſe Churches: this their Booke being a ſtumbling block in the
way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. 1. I ſuppoſe by the <hi>ſeekers</hi> here after
his Diſcipline, hee meaneth the Engliſh, <hi>non-conformiſts.</hi> Now in
this hee abuſeth them, and his Readers too; for howſoever they would
willingly ſhake off the <hi>Prelates yoke,</hi> notwithſtanding it is not
to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <pb n="23" facs="tcp:24844:16"/>his <hi>Claſſicall authoritie,</hi> but
rather to erect that <hi>ſingle uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded Policie</hi> (which hee
ſeemes to gibe at) whereby particular Congregations are made to be
independent: Not ſtanding un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any other Eccleſiaſticall authority out
of themſelves. And that this is ſo, I can proove it by many teſtimonies.
In a certain booke ſet out, under the name of all the unconformable
Miniſters in the Realme, they write thus: <hi>Wee confine</hi>

owne.</p>
               <p>To theſe wee will add <hi>D. Fulke,</hi> a man famous and of
rare learning, in his <hi>Learned Diſcours of Eccleſtaſticall
Gouvernment,</hi> hee ſaith, <hi>There ought to be in every Church an Elde

                  <hi>matters, pertayning to the Diſcipline and
Gouvernment of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</hi> I could name many more, but it needs
not; ſpecially becauſe I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeake againe of the
thing in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place. Yet this may not be forgotten. VVhereas there are many
hundreds of our Country-men in <hi>New-England,</hi> they have not erected
there any <hi>Claſſicall Gouvernment,</hi> but every particular Church
exerciſeth her owne, I ſay, within her ſelf wholy; which is a ſure
argument to proove, that the foreward profeſſours in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
approove not of this kind of gouvernment here pleaded for; although hee would
feigne haue his Reader to thinke ſo.</p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:24844:17"/>
               <p n="2">2. Whereas hee ſaith that our <hi>Booke is a ſtumbling
block, laid in the way of Reformation.</hi> I ſuppoſe it will appeare ſo
farre other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, as that hee himſelf will be found chiefly in fault this
way. And therefore I wiſh him, to be well adviſed, what hee writes
hereafter, leaſt the reaſons, which hee layeth downe for his gouverning of
many Churches, be applyed by the <hi>Popes men</hi> unto the
<hi>Hierarchy,</hi> and to as good purpoſe too. And truely I cannot ſee,
but this may well be ſo, conſidering that both their <hi>Diſciplines</hi>
tend unto the taking away of the <hi>Churches Right,</hi> the difference is; In
the <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy</hi> one doth it: In the Claſſes more; notwithſtanding
in this they joyne together; viz. in depriving Churches of their due and
law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full power.</p>
               <p>Tenthly hee ſaith I am injurious <hi>to all that are grieved
for the offence ariſing by this fact, hee being the cauſe of their
grief.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. 1. If any grieve to ſee errour diſcovered, the truth
clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, good men juſtifyed, unjuſt doers reprooved; it is their fault and
ſinne: But the writings publiſhed by me, ſerve for this end and uſe. 2.
If any haue given occaſion unto others of ſorrow, it is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
himſelf, in that he hath, by unlawfull meanes, keept from us the profitable
preaching of the mord, whereby wee ſhould have bene much furthered in the way
to life and glory. If a father ſhould withhold from his children
ſeaſonable and holeſome food; were it not a ſufficient cauſe of
weeping and mourning? For our parts, wee cannot judge otherwiſe of his
caraige towards us; howſoever hee bleſſeth himſelf in it.</p>
               <p>The 11 and laſt injury <hi>is to all that take pleaſure in
theſe offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, hee being a meanes to harden them in ſinne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. This is onely a begging againe of the queſtion, and

amongſt which there is not one, that anſwereth to the thing at all, nor
ſerves his turne in the leaſt for which hee bringeth it. It is not
neceſſary that I ſhould here write downe all his words; I will therefore
onely take the ſubſtance of them, which is thus: <hi>1. Wee accuſe other
Miniſters beſides himſelf. 2. The order againſt which wee complaine,
hath bene formerlie obſerved in our Church. 3. Wee are partiall, becauſe
wee diſliked not the thing ſooner. 4. Hee tells us what order the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods
have deviſed about the calling of Miniſters. 5. Wee are taught</hi> (a
thing never doubted of) <hi>that the Elders ought to goe before the people in
all the publick actions of the Church. 6. If this be not ſo great
abſurditie will follow. 7. If wee were apart well examined, hee aſſures
himſelf that few of us would be found to agree with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, touching
the due order of elections. 8. It is an heinous crime no leſse then
ſacriledge, to deprive the Church of her lawfull power.</hi> But is this to
anſwer, or rather in truth to play the <hi>Trifler.</hi> For what are theſe
<hi>8 Replies,</hi> but ſo many ſhifts and windings, even miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
ſtarting holes, and ſcope doores, for him to fly out at; doth hee not here
turne his backe upon the caſe, as not willing to ſtand to it.</p>
               <p>I wiſh hee would once againe read our Scriptures, and his
anſwer to them, and to perſwade him hereto; I will preſume (though I
looke to be requited with ſhrewd words for my labour) to propoſe it to his
view in this manner. If the complaint made by <hi>William Beſt,</hi> and the
Subſcribers with him, be againſt <hi>Mr. Paget</hi> &amp; others: If the
order againſt which they complaine be ancient: If they haue done ill in not
blaming the thing till now: If the Synods haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed and order of
calling Miniſters: If the Elders ought to goe before the Church in all
publike actions: If hurt will follow other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: If the Complaynants cannot
agree among themſelves, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="26" facs="tcp:24844:18"/>the due order of
elections: In ſhort, if it be a great ſinne to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive the Church of her
due power: Then doe not theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Act. 6.3. and 14.23. proove, that
Chriſt hath given full power to his Church, to chuſe freely their owne
Miniſters: But the firſt is true: Therefore the ſecond.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Paget</hi> needs not to take it amiſſe, that I have
ſyllogiſtically framed this argument for him: For beleeve it, unleſſe
it goe this way; a man may ſay of his reaſoning here, as of them in the
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbe, <hi>Hee aſked for hookes, and they ſay they have no
mattocks.</hi> Notwithſtanding I doe not impute this, to his inſufficiency;
but to the badnes of his caſe. Hee perceiving (in likelyhood) that theſe
Scriptures made for us, and againſt him; thought of a courſe how to put
them by, and ſave his owne credit too, and that was by hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Reader in
a long talke. For will not many thinke, when they ſhall read 7 or 8 ſcoore
lines writen to confute 3 or 4. But the thing is ſoundly done.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the matter in pag. 20. I would willingly know, why
he hath writen a whole ſide to proove that the <hi>Gouvernours of the Church
ought to goe before, &amp;c.</hi> hath this thing ever bene in queſtion?
Knoweth hee not, that our difference is not about our owne
<hi>Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip:</hi> But whither Officers of other Churches, have ought to

               <p>Let it here be obſerved, that <hi>Mr. Paget</hi> pleadeth for

                  </note> unto which
<hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Paget</hi> hath anſwered: But whether effectually, wee are now to

               <p>The firſt is Act. 20.28. <hi>Take heed therefore unto your
ſelves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you
over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Paget</hi> (as before) makes 8 Replyes; moſt
of which, I take them to be ſo impertinent, as not capable indeed of any
anſwer. Leaving the firſt to <hi>M<hi rend="sub">r</hi>. Davenport,</hi> becauſe it
concerneth his owne perſon; wee come to the ſecond, where hee writeth thus:
<hi>Suppoſe Paul in the place alledged, had required no more of the
Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours of Epheſus, yet might a further duetie have bene laid upon them
in ſome other place of Scripture. It is no good kind of disputing, to argue
thus, No more is required of Miniſters in ſuch and ſuch a place,
therefore in no other place at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. 1. Be it here noted, that theſe words tend unto the
up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of the vileſt errours that can be: For from the ground which hee
hath here laid downe, what Divine truth is there, but may be coulorably
gaine-ſaid and reſiſted. For example, If a man to proove that there are
three perſons in the <hi>Godhead,</hi> no more; ſhould alledge for it 1.
Ioh. 5.7. <hi>There are three that beare record in Heaven, &amp;c.</hi> Might
not a Heathen take up his words, and ſay: <hi>O Sir, it is no good kind of
disputing, to argue thus, No more are mentioned in ſuch, and ſuch a place,
therefore in no other place at all.</hi> I marvaill how <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Paget</hi>
would be able to ſtoppe ſuch an adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries mouth. In his next writing I
ſhall exſpect to ſee ſome thing about it. In the meane time I doe
advertiſe him to beware of theſe raſh and inconſiderate ſayings: Hee
cannot be ignorant, what a moſt daungerous worke hee hath ſet forth once
already. Seeking <pb n="29" facs="tcp:24844:19"/>by it (as one<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> Ainſ. Advertiſm. to the Read. at the end of the
<hi>5.</hi> Bookes of Moyſes, publiſhed in England by authority againſt
him.</note> truely chargeth him) <hi>to ſtrike at the very text, and to
weaken our common faith.</hi> For which thing hee lyeth to this day, under the
juſt Cenſure, and ſharpe reproofe of many Godly and Learned men. It would
be good therefore for him, in Iobs<note n="‡" place="margin">
                     <hi>Cha.</hi>
40.5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 42.6.</note> words to ſay, <hi>Once have I ſpoken, but
I will not anſwer, yea twiſe, but I will proceed no further: Wherefore I
abhorre my ſelf, and repent in duſt and aſhes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Whereas hee anſwereth with <hi>If,</hi> or <hi>might
be:</hi> this ſheweth that (being not able to avoyd the force of the
Scripture, yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to aſcent unto it) hee loves to be contentious, and
to ſeeke <hi>a knot in a riſh:</hi> If there be any place of Scripture, to
his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that doth require <hi>the Pastours of Epheſus, to baptiſe
ſuch infants whoſe Parents are without:</hi> it had bene his duety to have
named it. But if hee know no ſuch thing, (as I am ſure hee doth not) then
let him know, that his <hi>reaſoning</hi> is fruitleſſe and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
too. If a man will be perverſe, it is no maſtery to have a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction,
and to ſay ſome thing, though without brane or ſence. But what ſayth
Vives<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. <hi>1.</hi> de Cauſ. art. corrupt.</note>
                  <hi>They are baſe wits, that are ſo affected: For ingenious minds and
natures well given, will rather ſeeke how true that is, which they hold, then
how they may defend it, making grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter price of verity then victory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. To anſwer the thing more fully; the ordinary examples
of the Godly in Scripture, are ſet downe for our imitation; yea and wee are
exhorted to follow the ſame:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.8.9.10. 2
<hi>Ti.</hi> 3.10. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17 <hi>&amp;</hi> 10.11. <hi>Heb.</hi>
13.15 <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.25.26.27.</note> 
                  <hi>Theſe
things</hi> (ſayth <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>which yee have heard and ſeene in me,
doe.</hi> Hence it is, that the Apoſtle, having ſpoken of the vertues of
many true beleevers, <hi>Heb. 11.</hi> likeneth them in chap. 12.1. unto the
<hi>Cloud,</hi> which the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites had in the deſert, by which they were
guided unto the Land of Canaan.</p>
               <p>And in particular, the intent of the holy Ghoſt, in cauſing
the <hi>Acts of the Apostles</hi> to be recorded; was that the ſame ſhould
be as a <hi>Cloud,</hi> to direct us in the way to heaven. Now then to apply
<hi>Act. 20.28.</hi> to the matter in hand; whereas Paul appointeth the
<hi>Epheſian Elders,</hi> unto the care and charge onely of their owne
particular Congregation, and no further; it followeth neceſſarily, (this
being writen for our imitation) that every Miniſter under the Goſpell, is
to containe himſelf altogether, within the bounds and circuit of his owne
Church; and not to exerciſe <hi>any act of his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:24844:20"/>otherwhere: For to doe it, is meerely intruſion, and a
taking of to much upon him.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.24.</note>
Therefore <hi>Let every man wherein hee is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, therein abide with
God.</hi> Els others will be injured, good order broken, ſcandalls rayſed,
and the doer ſeverely puniſhed, for his irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular walking.</p>
               <p>Obſerve againe, how <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Paget</hi> makes uſe of the
Papiſts argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for thus writeth Scultingius: <hi>The Calvinists</hi>
(ſayth hee) <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that the authority of Biſhops and Archbiſhops, is
not from the Apostles,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hierarch. l. <hi>10.</hi> p.
<hi>79.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>becauſe Act. 15. the controverſie there was not
confirmed by them, but by the whole Church.</hi> Now marke how prittily hee
anſwereth to it: <hi>This will not follow, for the authority of Biſhops
&amp; Archbiſhops might be exerciſed at other times, in the Apoſtles
dayes, although then it were not.</hi> Thus hee drawes out Antichriſt ſword
againſt us, onely hee puts a new ſcabbard upon it.</p>
               <p>His third anſwer is, that <hi>Paſtours and Teachers are
bound to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe ſome acts of their ministery, towards thoſe who are no
members of their Church.</hi> And why ſo? <hi>Becauſe they ought to invite
and call others, even thoſe that are without, Prov. 9.3.4.5. Mat.
28.19.20.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. 1. I would willingly know of him, whither his office be
ſo with him, and alwayes about him, that hee cannot performe ſome good
actions, but they muſt needs be actions of his Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. I and others,
are otherwiſe minded; our reaſon is, becauſe wee are told, that as a man
and wife, a father and child; ſo a Paſtour and a Flock, are relatives. Now
in my underſtanding, as I am a father, I exerciſe no <hi>proper acts</hi>
of a father, but towards my owne chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; what good ſoever I doe to others,
it cannot properly be ſaid to be the act of a father, but rather of a freind,
a neighbour, a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, &amp;c. Now let him make further application of
it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For his two Scriptures; 1. Mat. 28.19.20. is very
unſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully quoted; for howſoever the Apoſtles exerciſed ſome
<hi>Acts of their miniſtery towards men without;</hi> yet this prooves not,
that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Miniſters may doe ſo too; but onely a thing ſo conceited
of him. The other place is anſwered before.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Hee ſaith, that <hi>a Paſtour may administer the
Sacraments, both of Baptiſme and the Lords Supper, in neighbour Churches; and
this</hi> 
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:24844:20"/>(hee ſayth) <hi>hee hath prooved against M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.
Ainſworth in Arr. pag. 17.18. and againe from pag. 109. to 114.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. 1. As Parents love their owne children, becauſe they
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat them, how ill-favored and black ſoever they are. So <hi>Mr.
Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get</hi> in this place, applaudeth his old writings, becauſe they are the
inventions of his owne head. I have 3 or 4 times read the places over; and I
doe aſſure thee (Reader) I find not any thing there prooved, of which hee
here ſo vainely boaſteth. For either hee takes that granted, which hee is
not able to proove; to wit, that the Elders, Deacons and widowes of one Church,
may adminiſter in another, by vertue of office; or els, like the unwiſe
mans building, his whole diſcours is without foundation. Hee tels us, that
<hi>the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhip of the ſeparated companie of Leiden did help M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.
Ainſworth in his Controverſie with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Iohnſon.</hi> VVhat then? muſt
it follow that they <hi>exerciſed ſome acts of their Ministery in another
Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> For ſooth ſo hee concludeth; but how truely, I will
here manifeſt in this argument. If the Magiſtrates of Amſterdam per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
ſometime a worke of mercy to the people at Harlem; then they exerciſe there
ſome acts of their Magiſtracy; but the firſt is true: Therefore the
ſecond. If <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Paget</hi> will compare his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of reaſoning with
this; hee ſhall ſee, that blood is not more like to blood, then theſe two
one the other.</p>
               <p>But I geſſe what cauſeth him to erre herein; Hee thinketh
that Officers of a Church, cannot be helpfull in ſome cauſes unto other
people, but they <hi>exerciſe acts of their Ministery:</hi> But the thing is
not ſo; for whatſoever they doe in ſuch caſes, they doe it not as
Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, but as Chriſtians, neither can they now doe more, (though
Miniſters in other Churches) then any other Brother may doe, being indued
with the like gifts.</p>
               <p>One thing here I cannot let paſſe, and that is touching his
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound reaſoning in pag. 110. Hee tels <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Ainſworth</hi> that
<hi>his ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude from a Huſband, is againſt himſelf.</hi> The
reaſon hee gives for it, is, becauſe <hi>a Huſband, notwithſtanding his
relation and bond unto his owne wife, may yet become a protectour, and guide of
the poore widow, that wants a Huſband, to performe theſe dueties.</hi> If
<hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Paget</hi> will ſtand to juſtify the true proportion of his
argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as it muſt neceſſarily hold, or els it is mere vanity: I will
hence proove from his writing, that adultery is lawfull; for thus I
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:24844:21"/>reaſon: That which is the peculiar duety of huſbands,
to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med towards their wives, is to give them due benevolence: But
huſbands notwithſtanding the relation and bonds unto their owne wives, may
performe the peculiar dueties of huſbands to poore widowes: Therefore
huſbands, notwithſtanding the relation and bond unto their owne wives, may
have the uſe of the bodies of poore widowes. If hee doe not grant this, hee
reaſoneth without reaſon. For I hope hee will not deny, but a man that is
no huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, may performe many kind offices <hi>to poore widowes;</hi> yea I
thinke hee will confeſſe, that a man unmaried, may doe as many good turnes
<hi>to poore widowes,</hi> as any huſband: If ſo, then of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
either hee muſt maintaine whoordome, as I ſayd before; or confeſſe that
which hee writes here, is moſt impertinent; and that the compariſon holds
no further but thus; viz. that any man out of office, may in other
Congregations performe as much due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; as thoſe which are not Miniſters
there.</p>
               <p>I hope his ſinne here was of ignorance, rather then of
wilfullnes, and that hee had a devotion to ſerve God a right, though hee
tooke not (in this) the right way, wherein hee will be ſerved. And thus much
is ſufficient to confute whatſoever hee hath there ſaid: Let us therefore
proceed to the next.</p>
               <p>For his 5 anſwer, I can better underſtand his meaning, then
make either ſence, or good Engliſh of it. To proove that a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour is
bound to exerciſe his Miniſtery, in ſome acts thereof, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe,
who are no members of his Church; hee brings the example of Claſſes and
Synods, where many Miniſters doe meet together, for the adminiſtration of
Diſcipline in them, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine and decide by a joint authority, the
caſes and controverſies of ſundry Congregations; and this hee ſayth is
to be ſeene in Act. 15.1.2.</p>
               <p>Anſw. Who ſeeth not that this plea, is none other, then a
meere begging of the queſtion; hee bringeth in the Claſſes and Synods for
his proofe, whereas hee ſhould firſt have prooved, that the power, which
they aſſume over many Churches, is lawfull. Before I come to lay downe my
particular anſwers to it, I ſhall entreat him in his next Booke, to
reſolve me theſe few Queſtions. 1. VVhither the Aſſembly, mentioned
in Act. 15. were a Synod or Claſſis. 2. How it can be manifeſted from
that place, that both are divine inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <pb n="33" facs="tcp:24844:21"/>as here
is affirmed. 3. How hee can naturally from thence rayſe this doctrine; viz.
excommunications and elections of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, are actions belonging unto
Claſſes and Synods. 4. VVhither it be <hi>Iure Divino,</hi> that
Eccleſiaſticall Officers of many Churches, are neceſſarily bound, to
determine by joint authority, the caſes of many particular Congregations; or
whither it be a thing arbitrary and left unto every mans liberty. 5. Whither
all ſuch caſes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, as are decided by many Miniſters,
combined into Claſſes and Synods; muſt ſo ſtand, as that particular
Congregations may not (if they thinke fit) reject the ſame, and practiſe
otherwiſe, then hath bene there determined by joint authority.</p>
               <p>I haue the more hope, that <hi>Mr. Paget</hi> will give a direct

any ſuch thing, for which it is alledged. For 1. here was no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination of

But before you make ſuch haſty concluſions; haue a little patience to

officers of theſe two Churches, being two hundred miles aſunder, were
combined, and mett ordinarily together (as the Claſſes doe) to determine
the caſes of many Churches. Or how doe you proove that there was any Officer
at all of Antioch, in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem at this time? Briefly, or how doe you
proove, that the Brethren ſent from Antioch, exerciſed authority in the
Church at Ieruſalem; yet all this you muſt make good, otherwiſe you are

               <p>Before I end this point, there are a few queſtions, which I
thinke very needfull to propound unto him. Touching his <hi>Catholike or
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſall Church.</hi> 1. By what Scriptures the name and nature of it, is
warranted. 2. VVhither all Parents with their infants (Iewes, Turkes and Pagans
excepted) be members thereof, or not. 3. VVhat are the notes of it. 4. VVhither
wee are to judge all the members of this large Church, to be true beleevers. 5.
If this univerſall Church be viſible, then I would know of him, why there
ought not to be (proportionable to it) a univerſall Miniſtery and
gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. I ſuppoſe, hee will be willing, to give a direct anſwer
unto theſe things, becauſe hee profeſſeth, <hi>to have a great deſire
to informe his oppoſite Brethren in the truth. Pref.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next Scripture is <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 4.17. <hi>And ſay
to Archippus, take heed to the Miniſterie, which thou haſt received of the
Lord, that thou full fill it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this hee ſayth nothing; but referreth the Reader to the
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, made to the former allegation; onely hee gathereth ſome
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations from the place. Now for me, to anſwer his nothing, with
ſome thing, it were worth nothing. Therefore I will paſſe this Scripture
over: notwithſtanding, I thinke fit (taking an example from him) to ſet
downe ſome notes alſo.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If the <hi>Miniſterie ought to be fullfilled;</hi>
then muſt not Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, marre their doctrine, with paſſion, girding,
ſpightfull ſpeaches, willfull oppoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, croſſe teaching &amp;c. of
purpoſe to diſcountenance the truth, and to hinder the growth of knowledge
and ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They ought not offenſively to publiſh unto the
world, the perſonall and ſecret fealings of Brethren; but in the ſpirit
of meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, privately ſeeke to reſtore them.</p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:24844:25"/>
               <p n="3">3. In their writings, they ſhould not ſet downe
untruths and ſlaunders, continuall begging of the queſtion, many words for
that which was never doubted of; and not a word to proove the points in
queſtion; but contrarywiſe by the Scriptures ſoundly convince the
gaine-ſayer.<note place="margin">Act. <hi>18.</hi> ult.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. They ought not to bring mens deviſes into the
Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and there to ſet them up, as part of Gods worſhip.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If the people muſt <hi>ſay to Archippus take heed,
&amp;c.</hi> then muſt not Miniſters, when they are admoniſhed for their
unſound doctrines, and bad gouvernment, reject the authority of the Church,
and ſhrowd them ſelves under the <hi>arme of fleſh,</hi> of purpoſe to
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in their evill courſes.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, if they muſt fulfill their Miniſtery; then
ſhould they not in their old age, be worſe in life and doctrine, then they
were in former time.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Mr. Paget</hi> thought it needfull, that his
<hi>Collections</hi> ſhould be obſerved; ſo let every godly Miniſter,
conſider whither it be not meet, that each of theſe things ſhould be
duely regarded of them.</p>
               <p>The third Scripture is taken from 1. <hi>Pet. 5.2. Feed the
Elock of God, which is among you, taking the overſight thereof, &amp;c.</hi>
To this hee firſt anſwereth; that <hi>ſheepheards for the defence and
benefit of their Flockes, &amp;c. have reaſon to combine themſelves
together, for the performance of ſome workes of their calling, towards the
endangered ſheep of other flockes: as appeareth Eſa. 34.1. Luk. 2.8. Gen.
29.2.8.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. Hee wrappeth his owne feet in the ſnare, hee layeth
for another: for the ſimilitude, as hee here applies it, makes againſt
himſelf altogether. For 1. Sheepheards are not ſimply tyed to combine
themſelves together. 2. Neither doe they it, but on ſome ſpeciall
occaſion. 3. For the combination it ſelf, it is not to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
authority over each others Flock; but joyntly to help one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other in common
caſes. To make now the compariſon hold in proportion: Miniſters of
ſundry Congregations, are not abſolutely bound, to combine themſelves
together, neither may they ſo doe; but upon ſome occaſion: And touching
the combination it ſelf, it muſt not be, to exerciſe any power over each
others Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <pb n="42" facs="tcp:24844:26"/>but either for mutuall
aſſiſtance, to reſiſt the common adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, or to diſcuſſe
and conſider of matters, for their better going foreward in piety and
godlynes.</p>
               <p>And this which I ſay is the judgement of our beſt Divines.
<hi>Wee doe</hi> (ſayth <hi>D. Whitaker</hi>) <hi>confidently affirme, that
at the firſt, Churches were gouverned onely by their owne
Ministers,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Conir</hi> 4. <hi>Quaeſt.</hi> 1.
<hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 14.</note> 
                  <hi>and were not ſubjected to other
Churches or Miniſters: not Coloſſe to Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus; not Philippi to
Theſsalonica: not theſe to Rome; nor Rome to any other: but they had all
equall power in themſelves, that is, indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant juriſdiction and
gouvernment. Neither did they ſeeke authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty otherwhere, either from
Praelate or Pope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two things our of theſe words may be gathered: 1. That the
primitive <hi>Churches</hi> were all <hi>independent bodies,</hi> not
ſubjected to any other ſuperiour Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction, then
unto that which was within themſelves. 2. It was not the manner of members,
to cary matters away from their owne Church, unto men of other Churches; under
a pretence, that they had authority above their owne <hi>Elderſhip</hi> and
Congregation: Notwithſtanding contrary to the firſt of theſe, is <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.
Pagets</hi> profeſſion; to the later his practiſe: but how able hee is,
either to refute <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Whitaker</hi> herein, or to juſtify himſelf, wee
ſhall heare hereafter; for hitherto hee hath bene ſilent in it.</p>
               <p>To his ſecond anſwer: That <hi>the word tranſlated
feeding, doth alſo ſignifie to rule and gouverne.</hi> I grant it. Againe
where hee ſayth: <hi>If this kind of feeding be restrained unto one
Congregation, then is all the authoritie and gouvernment of Churches, by
Claſſes and Synods, overthrowne thereby.</hi> This I grant too. And
further, that <hi>it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull for Aſsemblies of Miniſters to
exerciſe any act of power, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Congregation beſides their owne.</hi>
What doth now follow in his opinion: <hi>Then Miniſters</hi> (ſayth hee)
<hi>may not give their voyces for the deciſion of controverſies in any
Congregation beſides their owne: contrarie to the uſe of this word of
feeding, applied to ſuch in Iſraell, as exerciſed ſome acts of their
Miniſterie, for the help and benefit of divers Congregations, as Ezek. 34.2.
&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. 1. Doth not <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Paget</hi> ſee any difference,
betweene a Miniſters giving of his voyce, for the deciſion of a
controverſy, and exerciſing an act of power in another Congregation
beſides his <pb n="43" facs="tcp:24844:26"/>owne; indeed it ſeemes, that hee doth not:
and therefore moſt confuſedly hath here joyned them together. But other
men, can ſee otherwiſe; and teach otherwiſe too: they can put a plaine
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, betweene a Miniſters giving adviſe, and councill in the
matters of other Churches; and exerciſing authority and power over them.

               <p>Here let it be obſerved, that when wee uſed the like
ſpeach in our <hi>Proteſtation;</hi> viz. that <hi>wee doe reverentlie
eſteeme of the Claſſis, for councill and adviſe, in all difficult
matters, &amp;c. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Paget</hi> very angerly tels us, that this <hi>is but a

did give to Claſſes and Synods: Yea the Brownists themſelves doe ſeeme
to give as much:</hi> Not to ſpeake any thing of his <hi>gibing;</hi> wee
ſay, this is as much as God requireth of us; and therefore wee may not give
more unto them. I know <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Paget</hi> will take this ill, for hee loves
not to be ſo ſtreight laſed; as to haue his authority confined within in
one Congregation; but let him remember, though <hi>Adam</hi> found more roome
when hee was caſt out of Paradiſe, then within: yet his condition, I
ſuppoſe was never the more comfortable for that.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the place in Ezek. 34. it ſpeaketh not any thing,
of the thing for which hee bringeth it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Howſoever the Iſraelites met in ſundry places,
notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they were all but one Congregation; for their Synagogues
were not entyre Churches of themſelves; but parts or members of the nationall
Church. And therefore the Prieſts and Levites, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they were,
exerciſed not ſome <hi>acts of their Miniſtery,</hi> unto ſome, that
were not members of their Congregation, as hee injudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly affirmeth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Hee doth not well, to compare the nationall
ſheepheards in Iſrael, unto the Miniſters now under the Goſpel, who are
bound unto particular Congregations; In pag. 66. hee ſeekes to ſtrengthen
the authority of <hi>Claſses</hi> and <hi>Synods,</hi> by the Iewiſh
politie and gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: <pb n="44" facs="tcp:24844:27"/>Now the Papiſts to

truth is, if <hi>M<hi rend="sub">r</hi>. Paget</hi> intend to diſpute this way, they will cary
it, quite away from him. But I thinke hee will hereafter be more conſiderate,
and ſpeake no further of that manner, and forme of <hi>Church
gouvernment:</hi> ſeeing hee knowes, the moſt learned on our ſide, doe
condemne the Papiſts for it; viz. Iunius<note n="a" place="margin">Animad. v.

               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:24844:28"/>
               <p>Object. But what, <hi>if need require, that a Paſtour ſhould

                  <hi>both of Baptiſme and the Lords Supper, in neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Churches, that are
destitute, and hee is deſired thereunto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. 1. There is no precept, nor example in the Scriptures,
to proove that ſuch a thing ſhould be deſired: Good minds muſt uſe
good meanes alſo, otherwiſe they pleaſe not God. <hi>Obedience is better
then ſacrifice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. I reaſon thus; <hi>Whoſoever rightly adminiſtreth
the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: must doe it by vertue of a Ministeriall calling: But no man
can administer the Sacraments by vertue of a Miniſteriall calling, ſaving
in his owne Congregation: Therefore no Paſtour can rightly administer the
Sacraments, but in his owne Congregation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The laſt of this argument, which onely may be doubted of, I
proove thus: <hi>That which is a proper worke of an Apoſtle; is not to be
done by any ordinarie Miniſter: To adminiſter officiallie in more
Congregations then one, is a proper worke of an Apostle. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The propoſition is certain; the aſſumption is taught
generally by learned men: For in this very thing, they doe diſtinguiſh
ordinary Miniſters from Apoſtles, the firſt <hi>being tyed to one onely
Flock.</hi> The later having <hi>power and libertie to exerciſe their
Miniſterie any where.</hi> Plainly to this purpoſe writeth <hi>D. Whitaker,
The Apostles</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>received the kees from Christ, and power of
teaching, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting ſinnes, as common Biſhops of the whole World: but
all others of their owne Churches. In theſe things therefore, which the
Apoſtles had extraordinarily, Biſhops ſucceed them not, that is, in that
power, which is truely and properly Apoſtolicall.</hi> Marke, what hee
counteth Apoſtolicall; namely to be <hi>a common Biſhop,</hi> that is to
exerciſe a power in more Churches then one.</p>
               <p>Here I will paſſe over <hi>Rom. 14.5.23.</hi> becauſe I
find nothing in his anſwer, which concerneth the matter in controverſie
betweene us. The Scriptures following are theſe; viz. <hi>Act. 11.21.26. Gen.
17.10. Rom. 4.11. Act. 2.39.</hi> But before hee comes, to anſwer thoſe
Scriptures in particular; hee makes a great complaint, unto the Reader,
againſt <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport,</hi> and his oppoſite Brethren; for ſome
unjuſt doing in the queſtion betweene them; and their treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe is,
becauſe they have ſayd <hi>promiſcuous baptizing of all infants without
difference,</hi> Hence hee rayſeth this obſervation. <hi>A man
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:24844:28"/>that reads their writings, might eaſilie be brought to
doubt, whither Turkes or Iewes, Mahometists or Heathens, or infidelles, of what
Nation or ſect ſoever, did ſometime preſent their children to
bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, and that it was the cuſtome of the Dutch Church, to baptiſe
ſuch being preſented.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. I will not contend with him, whither it may be
poſſible, that any ſhould be ſuch <hi>Simplicians,</hi> as to make ſo
groundles an inference: But this I ſay, and will proove it alſo, that
<hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Paget</hi> goes about to deceive his Readers, in that hee would have
them to conceive, that it is not their manner, to baptiſe all infants brought
to them; but they make a diſtinction; admit ſome, others not. And whither
this be ſo, I appeale to his owne conſcience, are not Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards received
conſtantly to Baptiſme. If the Parents are knowne to be drunkards,
ſwearers, blaſphemers, excommunicates, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, &amp;c.
notwithſtanding their children are ſtill baptiſed, if they are brought to
the Congregation. Yea more then this: If the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents come not at all, <hi>to
nod the head,</hi> (of which thing wee ſhall ſpeake hereafter) yet this
hinders not the infants baptiſing; for it is enought if a girrle of 16 or 17
yeares, doe bring it, and there bow with the reſt to ſome queſtions
propounded to them.</p>
               <p>Now then let all judicious Readers judge; If wee had not juſt
cauſe to name it, <hi>a promiſcuous baptiſing:</hi> Seeing (as I ſaid)
thoſe which are not members of any Congregation; nor worſhip God in any
Congregation; but live rather without God in the world, make a mocke of ſin,
and count it their grace, that they are grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, even thoſe vile varlets;
when they will, may haue their ſeed baptiſed. I ſay as freely and
ordinarily, as thoſe which are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and men knowne to feare God.</p>
               <p>As for his mentioning of <hi>Turkes, Iewes,</hi> &amp;c. it is
vainely done; for all know, that ſuch doe not preſent their children to our
bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme; and therefore I wiſh him hereafter, rather in ſincerity to
ſeeke the truth; then with ſhifts, cavills, and evaſions, the
mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of his caſe and credit. Notwithſtanding this I muſt tell
him, I am verily perſwaded, that it would require all the witt and ſkill
<hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Paget</hi> hath; to proove that ſuch Parents, whoſe children hee
and others ſometime baptiſe, are not a great deale worſe in life and
converſation, then many <hi>Iewes, Turkes</hi> and <hi>Heathens.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:24844:29"/>
               <p>The next thing undertaken by <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Paget,</hi> is to proove,
that men may <hi>be reputed in the Covenant by testification of their faith and
repentance, though it were by a word or geſture of the body, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing
their conſent thereunto, ſo farre as to procure the admiſſion of their
infants to have the ſeale of circumciſion or Baptiſme, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth from
the holy records.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. 1. Hee layeth downe here a manifeſt untruth; (to
ſpeake the beſt of it) in affirming, that the Iewes under the Law, might
lawfully admit infants to the <hi>ſeale of circumciſion;</hi> before the
Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of them, were joyned actuall members to that viſible Church. For
this I gather to be his meaning, from theſe words: <hi>So farre as to procure
the admiſſion of their infants, to have the ſeale of
Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion.</hi> Beſides it muſt either thus be underſtood, or hee
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not his owne ſaying: For our queſtion reſpects onely,
ſuch infants, whoſe Parents are not joyned to any Church. And therefore
this muſt needs hold a juſt proportion with it. Now whither this be not a
great preſumption in him? let all judge, that are <hi>wiſe to
ſobriety;</hi> for to affirme a thing, againſt the expreſſe
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of God, and continuall practiſe of the Saints; of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to uphold by it, and unlawfull and ſinfull practiſe. Hee that feares the
Lord and his righteous judgements, as hee ought, will take heed not to deviſe
ſuch unſounds tenets.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the <hi>20 Scriptures,</hi> or more, which hee hath
here quoted; the truth is,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 152.</note> not one
of them, either hurts our caſe, or helpes his. For 1. I would know of him,
whither to ſay <hi>Yea, Amen, ſo be it,</hi> (whereby an externall
profeſſion of faith, love, and thankfullnes is ſhewed towards God) his
meaning be, that this conſiſteth in the pronunciation of the letters,
ſyllables, or words. Againe whither by <hi>nodding with the head,</hi> hee
intendeth ſimply the geſture, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reſpect to the fitnes of the
doer of it. If hee ſay, hee meanes nothing, ſaving <hi>bare
ſpeaking,</hi> and <hi>bare bowing.</hi> Then I ſay, it is <hi>a
blasphemous ſaying;</hi> for it is poſſible, that a bird, or a beaſt,
may doe ſo much. But on the contrary, if hee ſay, hee reſpecteth the
qualification and condition of the <hi>ſpeakers,</hi> and <hi>nodders,</hi>
then his whole matter fals to the ground: becauſe the <hi>ſpeakerss</hi>
and <hi>nodders,</hi> in queſtion, are altogether (for the preſent) unfit
and uncapable, to performe any Religious worke; for (as I ſayd) they are
knowne, to <hi>deny God in workes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi>

yet what calling hath <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Paget,</hi> to put ſuch a thing upon them.
Briefly, though hee will doe it; yet what reaſon haue wee to repute them, for
all this <hi>in the Covenant;</hi> ſeeing wee find in Scripture no warrant to
juſtify the action.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Be it granted, that the Church and people of God, in
ſome caſes, haue declared their conſent, by ſaying, <hi>Yea, Amen, ſo
be it,</hi> or by a geſture of the body; notwithſtanding it will not hence
fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that men and women, not joyned to any Congregation, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther intending
ſo to doe: Moreover knowne to be idolaters, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers and moſt prophaine
perſons, may be reputed in the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, by ſaying <hi>Amen,</hi> or
<hi>nodding with the head,</hi> unto a few que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions read out of a booke
unto them; and ſo lawfully procure <hi>the admiſſion of their infants
unto the ſeale of Baptiſme.</hi> Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding either this hee muſt

               <p>And that the Reader may be better perceive, the looſenes of
his reaſoning; I doe intreat him, to obſerve what wee ſay; and what hee
ſayth unto it: <hi>Whereas it is the cuſtome of the Dutch Church, to
baptiſe many infans, whoſe Parents are not members of any Church; when they
anſwer Yea at the Leiturgy of Baptiſme publickely, or by nodding the
head.</hi> This practiſe, ſayth <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport,</hi> and wee too, is
unlawfull. <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Paget</hi> to juſtify it, ſtepts in, and tels us, that
in Moyſes time, in Chriſts time, and after in the Apoſtles dayes; many
godly people; members of the Church, haue in ſome caſes, ſignifyed their
meaning, and their wills, by ſhort ſpeaches, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall geſtures: And
this is all the anſwer, that hee makes to it. So that hee maketh a ſhew of
remooving the objection; but in truth leaveth it altogether untouched.</p>
               <p>But by his leave, ſeeing hee ſlides away from the point; I
muſt intreat him, to come back againe to it; and plainely to proove un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us
theſe 3 things, which hee very cunningly takes for granted. 1. By what
authority hee publickely propoundeth certaine que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, unto people, that
are not members of any particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation; and will have them, to
anſwer, with <hi>Yea,</hi> or <hi>nodding the head,</hi> or the like. 2. How
it can appeare, that ſuch, are to be counted Chriſtians, in the ſence of
the Scriptures, which are viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly <pb n="50" facs="tcp:24844:30"/>wicked men; manifeſt
no fruit of faith and repentance, but when ſome queſtions are mooved to
them; and then all that they doe, is to ſay; <hi>Amen,</hi> or to <hi>nod
with the head,</hi> at the afore-ſayd queſtions.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Seeing it is the judgement of the Learned<note n="*" place="margin">D. Cha. ſer. on Rom. <hi>12</hi> p. <hi>53.</hi> Chriſoſt in

ſo concluded. I would know then, what warrant men have, <hi>to read a

not ignorant, that untill hee have cleared theſe things, all that hee hath
yet ſayd, is frivolous and impertinent.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, let it be againe obſerved, that the Papiſts<note n="*" place="margin">Bellarm. de Ecc. Mil. c. <hi>2</hi> See Sutclif. Chal. c.

God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. 1. This allegation was not brought, to ſhew, <hi>by
what words or ſignes the faith full profeſſed their converſion unto
God;</hi> but to proove, that men muſt firſt beleeve, and be joyned to
ſome vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church; before they can be counted Chriſtians, in that
ſence, as to procure (to uſe his words) the admiſſion of their infants,
to haue the ſeale of Baptiſme. But to this hee ſaith nothing; but takes
up a matter, which hee needed not; and paſſeth by, what hee ſhould haue
ſpoken.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Be it granted, that <hi>it cannot be ſpecified by
what words, &amp;c.</hi> yet it can be manifeſted, that they ſhewed, ſuch
faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as <hi>the grace of God appeared in them.</hi> verſ.
23. Now ſuppoſe <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Paget</hi> were to make a Sermon, on the doctrine
of faith, or repentance: I doe thinke, when hee ſhould come to ſet downe
the <pb n="51" facs="tcp:24844:30"/>evidences of theſe graces; hee would not affirme,
that Atheiſts, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, theeves, murderers, &amp;c. haue them;
notwithſtanding the Parents of thoſe children, for whoſe Baptiſme hee
here pleadeth, are (I ſay many of them) ſuch vile wretches, as hee well
knowes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is to be inquired; whither his meaning be, to
compare, thoſe <hi>Diſciples,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians, Act.

I muſt be bold to tell him, that as hee diſhonoureth the <hi>primitive
Saints;</hi> ſo himſelf much more. On the otherſide, if hee ſay, hee
intendeth no ſuch thing, then hee might haue ſpared much labour, ſaved
charge, and ſpent his time more profitably, then to write many words, and all
juſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I marvaile, what was in his mind, when hee wrote this
anſwer. Hee aſketh, <hi>How it can be prooved from hence, that ſuch as
conſented unto the doctrine of the Gospel, propounded unto them, by
anſwering Yea, or bowing their heads, might not thereupon, he admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto

               </p>
               <p>Anſw. 1. I doe not yet underſtand, how hee rayſeth this
obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; viz. that <hi>the beleevers in Act.</hi> 11. <hi>conſented to
the doctrine of the Gospel, by anſwering Yea to it, or bowing their bodies,
in testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of their liking thereof.</hi> I perceive it is an eaſy thing,
to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; if begging may procure one that. But I mind not to give the
caſe ſo away: Therefore I doe deny, that ever theſe embraced the truth in
ſo abſurd a ſort; And ſeeing this is an aſſertion of his owne head;
it lies him now upon, to juſtify it. Tertullian<note n="*" place="margin">In
his booke of preſcript. ag Heret.</note> ſayth, <hi>It is not lawfull for
men to flatter themſelves, with any thing of their owne opinion and

Apostles for example, who taught nothing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their owne pleaſure, but
faithfully the doctrines, which they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. If by pronouncing the doctrine of the Goſpell, hee

I doe againe deny, that there was in the Apoſtles dayes, any ſuch thing
practiſed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If it ſhould be granted (which hee cannot proove)
that thoſe Chriſtians at Antioch, <hi>conſenied to the doctrine of the
Gospell, by anſwering, Yea to it; or bowing their heads, in testimony of
their approbation of it.</hi> Yet this helpes not his caſe at all;
unleſſe hee can <pb n="52" facs="tcp:24844:31"/>proove, 1. That they were not members
of any viſible Church. 2. That their converſation was irreligious. 3. That
they preſented their infants to the Miniſter in the Congregation, and after
ſaying <hi>Yea,</hi> or <hi>nodding</hi> the head, to ſome queſtions
propounded, had them baptiſed. Thus are his anſwers very wind, and no more
ſavour in them, then in the white of an egg, eaten without ſalt.</p>
               <p>The next allegation is Gen. 17.10. <hi>This is my Covenant,
which yee ſhall keepe, betweene me and you, and thy ſeed after thee: Everie
man child among you ſhall be circumciſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Paget</hi> to this anſwereth: <hi>It can not hence be
ſhewed that more queſtions were propounded to the Parents, which brought
their children to be circumciſed, then are now in the adminiſtration of
Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, &amp;c. Or that ſuch had circumciſion denied unto their
children, which ſhewed a willingnes to embrace the Covenant, by ſuch brief
anſwers and geſtures wee ſpeake off.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. Here are words; but in truth not a word, concerning the
matter, for which hee bringeth them. This Scripture <hi>Gen. 17.10.</hi> was
alledged to ſhew, that ſuch <hi>are to be counted Christians
chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> (and ſo conſequently to have right unto Baptiſme)
<hi>whoſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents</hi> (at leaſt one of them,) <hi>in externall

Davenport.</hi> Now if a man read the others reply: hee muſt needs
confeſſe, unleſſe hee will confeſſe himſelf to be a
<hi>Simplician,</hi> and ignorant in Logicke and Religion, that it is as
indiſgeſted a thing, as ever was broched by a man of learning: much better
therefore it had bene, if hee had left, this looſe kind of reaſoning; and
either diſprooved, ſome part of the others proofe, according to the rules
of reaſon; or yeelded to the concluſion, which followeth by force of
argument.</p>
               <p>But to make a ſhort anſwer to his ſpeach; although it
looke not unto the thing, for which hee deviſed it. 1. How doth he know, that
there was <hi>a Leiturgie of Circumciſion</hi> in the Church of God under the
Law? and that it was propounded to thoſe Parents, which brought their
children to be circumciſed. This I lay up on him, as another invention of his
owne: for it is moſt certaine, never was there ſuch a thing practiſed, by
the Fathers, in old time; neither haue the Iewes in theſe dayes any

ſearched, which treat of the manner of <pb n="53" facs="tcp:24844:31"/>circumciſion,
there will be found no ſuch thing in them, whereof hee ſpeaketh.</p>
               <p>Among many other good properties, which hee himſelfe ſaith,
hee hath; one is, that<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 104.</note>
                  <hi>hee is no inventer of new conceits and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</hi> But ſurely, if the
reſt there, be not truer then this, hee will be found an untrue ſpeaker in
them all.</p>
               <p>Further I would know of him, what hee intendeth by
<hi>embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Covenant:</hi> (for I perceive hee ſeeketh advantage by
double conſtruction of words) Is it his meaning, that thoſe, which were no
Iewes, nor members of the Iewiſh Church; yer brought not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their
infants unto the Preiſts; and when they had anſwered to ſome queſtions,
either by ſaying <hi>Yea,</hi> or <hi>nodding with the head;</hi> they had
them immediately circumciſed, although them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, remained ſtill, out
of the communion and fellowſhip of the Church. If this be his meaning (as it
muſt needs be, unleſſe his meaning were to write juſt nothing) then I
doe affirme, that in this, hee hath ſpoken irreligiouſly, injuriouſly and
untruely. 1. Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly, to have the ſeale of the righteouſnes of
faith, to be made an unholy thing. 2. Injuriouſly to accuſe Gods choſen
of finne, cauſeleſly. 3. Vntruely; and thus I proove it. None might eat of
the Paſſeover, unleſſe they were members of the Iewiſh Church,
<hi>Exod. 12.6.45.</hi> But all circumciſed among them, might eat of the
Paſſeover, <hi>verſ. 44.</hi> Therefore all the circumciſed among them,
were members of the Church.</p>
               <p>If the Reader deſire, to know further about this thing; let
him him peruſe <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Ainſworths Annotations</hi> on Geneſ. 17. and
Exod. 12. and there hee ſhall ſee, what the Iewes write of it; viz. that
none are to communicate with the Church, in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of circumciſion,
and the Paſſeover, but ſuch as are members thereof.</p>
               <p>The next Scripture is Rom. 4.11. <hi>And hee received the
ſigne of circumciſion, a ſeale of the righteouſnes of ſaith, which
hee had yet being uncircumciſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:24844:32"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Pagets</hi> anſwer to this allegation may be caſt
into 3 heads, or branches. 1. <hi>Abraham is called the father of all that
beleeve, whither members of a particular Church or not. 2. There might be
ſome beleevers in Abrahams time, not members of his familie, nor under the
gouvernment of any particular Church. 3. If a ſonne, or bond ſervant of
Ephron, the Hittite were then brought to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the true God,
&amp;c. why might not the infant of ſuch a one have bene circumciſed,
though not living in a viſible Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. I will not ſay, that <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Paget</hi> hath read
Antonies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in Tully<note n="*" place="margin">De Orat. l.
<hi>2.</hi>
                  </note>, who wiſheth men, <hi>if they be troubred about a hard
question, to ſay nothing to it.</hi> But this I can ſay of him by
expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience; hee fol owes that rule cloſely. For as before, ſo here againe,
hee uſeth many words; but anſwereth not at all to the point in hand.</p>
               <p>This Scripture (as may be ſeene in the place<note n="‡" place="margin">Iuſt Comp. pag. <hi>5.</hi>
                  </note>) was brought to proove, that
as Abraham received circumciſion, when hee was a member of a viſible
Church; ſo conſequently baptiſme, which comes in the roome thereof,
belongeth peculiarly to ſuch, as are joyned to ſome particular
Congregation. <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Paget</hi> perceiving (as it is probable) the ſtrenght
of the argument, cunningly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawes himſelf from it; and that the Reader
might not ſee it, hee ſets downe 2 or 3 conceited fancies of his owne, unto
which briefly thus I anſwer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Imagen, I ſhould deny that there were in Abrahams
time any beleevers, out of his family; or contrarywiſe, ſay I grant there
were, what would hee hence inferre? for my part I know not; nor yet hee
himfelf, I am perſwaded.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Concerning his <hi>why not,</hi> I aſke of him for
his <hi>why ſo.</hi> Is it the manner of Diſputers, to propound a caſe,
and then aſke of the ſtanders by, <hi>(Sirs) why may it not be thus.</hi>
If there be any Divine patterne for ſuch a practiſe, it now concerneth you
<hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Paget</hi> to ſhew it: If you cannot (as I am ſure you cannot)
then I wiſh you in ſuch caſes hereafter to <hi>ſhurt your
lips</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Pr.</hi> 17.28</note>, and ſo you
ſhall be eſteemed a man of the better underſtand.</p>
               <p>But to deliver you (if it may be) from your vaine conjectures
and doubts: As for circumciſion, it was not commaunded to the Gentles at all;
neither was it a ſeale of the Covenant of grace to <hi>Noe</hi> and his
ſeed: But was commaunded to Abraham, and his <pb n="55" facs="tcp:24844:32"/>ſeed, and
houſe-hold, and ſuch onely as would be of that Church, and partake of the
Paſſeover. Therefore it not being commaunded to Noes ſonnes, ſuch as
abode in his faith, (howbeit ſcattered afarre of) were doubles in the
Covenant of grace ſtill, and ſaved as well as wee: I ſay without
circumciſion, for the ſame was not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on them. And this is the
judgement of learned men; viz. <hi>Paraeus</hi>

               </p>
               <p>His whole anſwer hereto is this: <hi>Though the promiſe be
made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch as are called, yet who can ſhew, that ſuch are not to be
coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted outwardlie called, and in ſome meaſure within the priviledge of
the Covenant, who being themſelves alreadie baptized, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
themſelves from other ſects and Churches, doe bring their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants unto the
true Church to be baptized, being there alſo readie to make a publicke
profeſſion of their faith before the Congregation.</hi> Thus hee.</p>
               <p>Anſw. 1. For his phraſe here, to count men outwardly called,
I ſee no warrant for it in all the Scriptures: For whomſoever in the
judgement of charity, wee can judge <hi>to be outwardlie called,</hi> them (I
take it) are by us to be judged inwardly called alſo.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.7. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.</note> I confeſſe
indeed, if wee haue reſpect unto God, then it may be ſaid, that <hi>ſome
are onely outwardlie called:</hi> But who theſe <hi>(ſome)</hi> are, wee
cannot tell; and therefore wee may not give ſentence in it.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ro.</hi> 14.14.</note> If hee ſay, that hee intended both;
then I anſwer; 1. Hee ſhould haue done well, to haue ſpoken out plainly
ſo. 2. Then it muſt follow, that all ſuch Parents, whoſe infants hee
and others baptiſe; be their converſation never ſo bad, are
notwithſtanding in his opinion the elect and choſen of God. 3. Hee ought
not to keepe backe one of them, from his Congregation; if they deſire to be
members thereof. Againe, But if hee ſay, hee judgeth them not to be
<hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly called;</hi> then by his owne confeſſion, it muſt follow,
that they want true faith and repentance: and ſo hee giveth (and that of
knowledge) holy things to the unworthy, and to perſons who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uncapable
thereof.</p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:24844:33"/>
               <p n="2">2. I cannot tell what hee intendeth, by <hi>the priviledge
of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;</hi> if hee meane Baptiſme, then I anſwer: This ordinance
is given to the Church, and no perſon lawfully may be admitted to it,
unleſſe hee be a member thereof<note n="*" place="margin">See the two next
Sections.</note>. If hee have any other mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, when I know it, I ſhall be
ready to give a further anſwer to it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For what reaſon doth hee add theſe words, viz.
<hi>and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing themſelves from other ſects and Churches.</hi> Is it
not, becauſe (as I ſayd before) hee would haue people thinke, that it is
not their practiſe, to baptiſe all infants brought unto them. Me thinkes if
his heart perſwades him, that his caſe is good, hee ſhould not ſeeke
thus cloſely, to with-draw the Reader from the queſtion; but ſpeake out
clearely in it, and to this purpoſe; ſay: <hi>It is the custome of the
Dutch Church, and my practiſe alſo: that what infants ſoever are brought
unto us, for Baptiſme, to baptiſe them; be the Parents of them, holy or
unholie members of any particular Church, or not. Yea howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever wee know
that the children preſented unto us, are Bastards; yet if the Parents, or in
their abſence ſome other, doe ſhew a conſent unto certaine queſtions,
either by nodding with the head, or ſaying Yea, Amen, or ſo be it: wee put
them not backe, neither ought wee; but give them the holie ſeale of
remiſſion and pardon of finne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed this had bene plaine dealing, and nothing but the truth.
And therefore whereas hee tels us, of men <hi>outwardlie called, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
themſelves from other ſects.</hi> And againe<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 145.</note>, <hi>of having more knowledge of the
truth, &amp;c. then ſome of thoſe that are members of the Church.</hi> What
is this, but meere dawbing; for what uſe ſerves it, but like the <hi>rough
garment</hi> to deceive. Hee knowes, and wee know it too: If infants be brought
in the manner aforeſayd, all is well: it matters not whoſe children they
be; viz. whither <hi>Engliſh, Dutch, French, &amp;c.</hi> nor how vile and
wicked the Parents of them haue formerly alwayes bene, to that houre and time.
I would not ſpeake ſo often of this thing, but that hee conſtraineth me
to it, in regard hee laboureth to hide from the Readers, the true knowledge of
the point in queſtion. But hence let it be conſidered, whither in this hee
give not cauſe of juſt ſuſpition unto them to thinke, that hee is
aſhamed to appeare <hi>a Defendant.</hi>
                  <note n="‡" place="margin">So
hee cals himſelf in pag. <hi>146.</hi>
                  </note> in the caſe, as it ſtands

               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:24844:33"/>
               <p>The laſt Scripture is <hi>1. Cor. 5.12. For what have I to
doe, to judge them alſo that are without, doe not yee judge them that are
within.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this firſt <hi>Mr. Paget</hi> anſwereth: <hi>It is not
plainely diſcribed, how M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport applies this ſentence, to the
queſtion in hand; it had bene good, if hee had ſhewed, how hee had drawne
his argument from hence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. <hi>M<hi rend="sub">r</hi>. Paget</hi> among many Diſputers, had the
leaſt reaſon, to make a complaint this way; for hee in his writing, not
onely leaves the maine points in controverſy untouched; but alſo, for the
unneceſſary matters, which hee bringeth in, they are ſuch oracles, or
rather riddles; as to underſtand them, a man had need hee were either another
<hi>Oedipus,</hi> or had hee himſelf preſent to expound them.
Notwithſtanding hee ſhould have remembred, that hee being the doer of the
things in this controverſy, the burden of prooving lay directly on his
ſhoulders: And therefore it had bene his part plainely to have demonſtrated
from the Scripture, that which hee affirmeth, touching the <hi>Claſſis</hi>
and <hi>Baptiſme;</hi> for one teſtimony or argument rightly drawne from
the Apoſtolicall writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, to juſtify theſe aſſertions, will
eaſily draw us to acknowledge them. But till then; though hee write ten
volumes more, and each of them, ten times greater then this; yet never ſhall
hee be able to convince the conſcience, of any indifferent Reader, in the
points which hee hath undertaken to be a <hi>Defendant;</hi> to wit, 1. that
<hi>particular Congregations are to be dependent bodies: and to ſtand under
other Eccleſiasticall authoritie out of themſelves. 2. That in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants may be
baptized, whoſe Parents are not joyned to any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar viſible
Church.</hi> But to the point.</p>
               <p>This Scripture fitly ſerves, to proove the point in hand; for
the ſcope and drift of the Apoſtle there, is to ſhew, that members of
viſible Churches, haue onely right unto the publicke ordinances
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred therein. As for others, <hi>they are not to be judged;</hi> that
is, in thoſe publicke things the Church hath no relation to them; nor may (I
ſay in this reſpect) haue communion with them. And hence I reaſon thus:
If the infants in queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are without, then may they not be admitted unto
Church communion; and ſo conſequently not to baptiſme. But they are
without; Therefore, &amp;c. The propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is manifeſt by this Scripture
<hi>1. Corint. 5.12.</hi> The aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <pb n="58" facs="tcp:24844:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>is
evident, and needeth no proofe.</p>
               <p>After this hee tels us, <hi>of 3 ſorts of perſons, which may
be ſaid to be without. 1. Members of a viſible Church, wanting true faith.
2. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidells and Heathens. 3. Thoſe that for the preſent live not under
the Diſcipline and Gouvernment of ſome particular Church, and yet make
profeſſion of the ſame Religion, with the true viſible Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
&amp;c. This later practiſe ſome imperfect communion with them: and
therefore in ſome ſence may be ſaid to be of ſuch Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. 1. Howſoever the Lord knoweth who are his; yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<hi>Mr. Paget,</hi> nor any man elſe, judge men to be without true faith, and
ſo <hi>no members of the inviſible Church:</hi> ſpecially they
ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding members of ſome particular Congregation; and therefore his talke
here, is altogether fruitles, and nothing concerneth the place <hi>1. Cor.

(by the Lords aſſiſtance) in this, and the following <hi>Sections;</hi>
to ſet downe the ſame. And becauſe all our troubles, haue proceeded (as
it were) from two cauſes; viz. the Baptiſme of <hi>Non-members,</hi> and
the denying of the <hi>Churches power.</hi> I ſhall therefore ſpeake of
theſe <hi>two things,</hi> the more fully. And firſt of the Baptiſme: Now

                     <hi>Therefore it is a great ſinne to doe it.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>propoſition</hi> is evident by theſe Scriptures,

let it be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that unto <hi>all Church-actions,</hi> as there is
<hi>Faith,</hi> ſo <hi>order</hi> alſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily required: And hence
is the difference onely, betweene <hi>Christian-communion,</hi> and
<hi>Church-communion:</hi> to practiſe <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian-communion,</hi> there
needeth nothing but viſible Chriſtianity; but to the other, as there muſt

follow many abſurdities, and great confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                  <p>This may be further illuſtrated by a ſimilitude, taken
from a <hi>Corporation,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.</note> to which the
Church of God is ſometimes compared. Wee know that many, who are no members

their owne writings, and deſtroy againe the things, which they haue

               <p n="3">3. Seeing (by comparing their practiſe, with their

this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome becomes the greater blot and diſhonour unto them. That they
are not true to their grounds, I have manifeſted before. To which this
further may be added. In a Synod held at <hi>Dort Anno 1578.</hi> it was there
agreed, that <hi>all Parents before they brought their children to be baptized,
ſhould got unto the Miniſters or Elders, that ſo they might give notice
unto the Church, whoſe child it was, that ſhould be baptized.</hi> Now for
what end, ſhould the Parents be enjoyned, to acquaint the <hi>Church
Officers</hi> with this thing; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe their meaning was, that none but
<hi>members children,</hi> ſhould be baptiſed. If they had intended, that
things ſhould be, as they are now: (baptiſe all brought to the
Congregation) then truely (with reverence be it ſpoken) they made a very
unneceſſary <hi>article;</hi> for what need is there, of telling the
Church, whoſe children they are, if all brought there muſt be baptiſed.

them, and reject them altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if they be not fit. So did they in old time

one Authour, which hath in his Commentaries on the Scriptures, taught the
doctrine maintained by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Paget</hi> here againſt us. It is true,
ſome of them, grant to the Elderſhip greateſt authority; others to the
body of the Congregation: Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, none haue bene ſo erronious, as
to ſay, that the whole Church (I meane Officers and Brethren) wants authority
to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme in, and for it ſelf, all <hi>Church-ſervices.</hi> Now for the

Are they not <hi>authenticke witneſſes?</hi> If you confeſſe it; then
marke what followes; viz. your poſition that <hi>particular Congregations
muſt ſtand under other Eccleſiaſticall authoritie out of
themſelves;</hi> is hence condemned, by a <hi>jurie</hi> of more then 24 men,
of your owne chuſing; for an errour and untruth: The reaſon is; becauſe
theſe affirme (I ſay all of them) that every particular Elderſhip, with
the Churches conſent, may lawfully proceed among themſelves to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:24844:47"/>the excommunicating of offenders, whenſoever there is
neceſſary and juſt cauſe. Neither doe they ſay a word; that it is
<hi>a Divine institution,</hi> that the Miniſters of one Congregation, muſt
firſt aſke the leave and conſent of other Miniſters, before they can
lawfully adminiſter this ordinance of God.</p>
               <p>And therefore I make ſome queſtion, whither you haue not
wronged <hi>this multitude of learned and Godly Ministers;</hi> in repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

               <p>And I haue the more reaſon thus to thinke, conſidering what

write; (two great lightes that ſhined ſometime in England) to wit, that
<hi>Eccleſiaſticall power and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is in the whole Church; but the

and writeth thus: <hi>In the primitive Church, the people did propoſe name,
elect, and decree, as well as the Clergie, and though the Preſbyterers had
more ſkill to judge; Yet the people had as much right, to chuſe their
Pastour: and if they moſt of them did agree, they did cary it away from the
other.</hi> Againe<note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Paget</hi> in pag. 22. doth acknowledge, that
<hi>Chriſt hath appointed but one order, for the chooſe both of Paſtour
and Deacon.</hi> As hee ſpeakes there, the truth: ſo by it, hee quite
overthrowes his owne cauſe; for if <hi>Paſtours</hi> muſt be choſen the
ſame way, that <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons</hi> are; and they (if the Apoſtles precept be
kept) choſen by the free conſent of the Congregation, wherein they are to

diſanull, whatſoever the others doe herein.</p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:24844:47"/>
               <p>I know what the Papiſts and Hierarchy ſay, to juſtify

<hi>11</hi> pag. <hi>134.</hi>
                  </note>: <hi>The unrulines of the people
deſerved afterwards to have their liberty taken away.</hi> The others ſay
thus: <hi>Why doe ye call us back to the primitive Church? As if wee are to be
tyed to the first beginnings of things, as if ye would bind little infants in
their blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, with ſwalding bondes? And as if it were not lawfull for us,
to change thoſe primitive rudiments, which were not then ſo proffitable in

               <p>Which of theſe two arguments hee will make uſe off, I yet

it.</p>
               <p>But becauſe I know not, what his anſwer ſhall be, I will

                  <hi>this manner of election was neither
eſſentiall, nor perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall. For after when experience taught that
confuſion and ambition (ryſing by the occaſion of the multitude
increaſing) was to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented: The Synod of Laodicea prudently tooke order
by their</hi> 13 <hi>Canon, that the election of ſuch, as were choſen to
the ſacred Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie, ſhould not be permitted to the multitude or
people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My purpoſe is not to ſay any thing now of that Synod: how,

<hi>16.</hi>
                  </note>, ſome are falſe; others fooliſh; and many very
ſuperſtitious. This onely I deſire the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to note, whereas it is
here objected, that this Synod, prohibited the body of the Congregation, from
uſing that liberty and power, which they before alwayes had in
Eccleſiaſticall gouvernment; and <hi>gave it</hi> (as hee ſayth a little
after) <hi>to aſſembly of Pastours:</hi> By this <pb n="96" facs="tcp:24844:53"/>teſtimony then, that which I ſayd, but now is further confirmed;
namely, that the Claſſicall authority is neither <hi>divine</hi> nor
ancient; for this Synod of Laodicea was held after the death of Iovinian the
Emperour: Anno 370. or thereabout.</p>
               <p>Thirdly hee pretendeth that the Diſcipline, which hee

               <p>Anſw. 1. It is a ſtrange courſe, when there ariſeth a
controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy touching two contrary opinions, which of them is true, and to be
embraced; to draw the reſolution hereof, to the conſideration of the
uſefullnes of the opinions, or practiſes queſtioned. As if, becauſe a
thing is uſefull, therefore it is to be concluded it is true: And not rather
in caſe, it be found to be true, yea the very truth of God, the rule whereof
is Gods word, therefore wee ought to conclude, it is uſefull, and be carefull
to make ſuch uſe of it, as wee are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded: But what more common now a
dayes, then for me, to obtrude their owne deviſes upon people, upon a bare
pretence of the uſefullnes of them in mans judgement: But in the meane time
doe not thoſe which take ſuch courſes, for the maintenance of their way,
manifeſt hereby, that their cauſe is deſperate, and that it ſeemes,
they haue no grounds, for their opinions out of the word of God I ſay, when
they runne out, unto ſuch divinations as theſe, for the ſupporting of
their labouring and wavering cauſe.</p>
               <p>As for example, if the Scriptures doe directly teach: <hi>That
every particular Congregation hath power to exerciſe Eccleſiasticall
Gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and all Gods other ſpirituall ordinances, in, and for it

unles it appeare in our phantaſie more uſefull then the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let it againe be obſerved, that the Papiſts and

                  </note> 
                  <hi>the
remedie was worſe then the deſeaſe.</hi> And truely, ſo wee may ſay
of all deviſes of <pb n="97" facs="tcp:24844:53"/>men, brought into the worſhip of God;
although the Authours doe it to prevent this, or that evill: notwithſtanding
the invention it ſelf, prooves (and wee haue ſeene it by experience) more
hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, then the thing pretended againſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I doe deny that this Gouvernment by Claſſes and
Synods, ſerves better for the Churches wellfaire, then that, which the
Apoſtles inſtituted; and the primitive Churches firſt practiſed. Wiſe
Politicians in their inſtitutions of Gouvernment, doe hold for an infallible
maxime, that to reforme corruptions and abuſes in ſtates, a better courſe
cannot be taken, then to reduce things to their primitive originall. Hereto
agrees D. VVhites<note n="*" place="margin">Of the Church l. <hi>2.</hi> pag.

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. If it ſhould be granted, that particular
Congregations, by this kind of gouvernment, ſhall haue peace, profit, credit
and other worldly reſpects: yet this is no ſufficient reaſon to induce
them to embrace it. For 1. wee muſt ſeeke peace by lawfull meanes. 2.
Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward quietnes, is not alwayes neceſſary for the Church; the Truth is
like unto Camomill, the more you preſſe it downe, the faſter it groweth,
and ſpreadeth further, and ſmelleth ſweeter. 3. Religion can
ſubſiſt, without externall peace: I ſay, ſafely in the midſt of
contentions. 4. It is better to want this freedom, of which hee ſpeaketh,
holding faſt the truth; then in ſinne to haue it, and periſh for it. 5.
It is a rule among Lawers<note n="‡" place="margin">Bartol. Diſtinct.

                  </note>, that publicke profit, muſt not take place againſt

this preſent; ſeeing the practiſe hath continued among us many yeares,
&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. Formy part, I never knew, that our Congregation was in
ſuch deepe bondage; untill <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Hookers</hi> troubles began; but thought
verely, that our owne Elderſhip, with the Brethren jointly together, had full
power among themſelves, to practiſe every ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God. And the thing
ſpecially, which induced me ſo to thinke, was his owne words<note n="*" place="margin">Ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ow againſt
ſep. pag. <hi>116.</hi>
                  </note>, writen to <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Ainſworth;</hi>
repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting how hee was firſt made our Miniſter, hee ſayth: <hi>The Dutch
Elderſhip in this City being deſired, hath for their counſell and help in
his ordination; deputed three of their Brethren, to aſſiſt us in this
buſines, &amp;c. this they did not, as aſſuming authoritie</hi>
                  <note n="‡" place="margin">Note.</note> 
                  <hi>to themſelves over us: but in our
name, and by our request. Being now eſtabliſhed, when as of late another
Miniſter was called unto our Congregation, <pb n="99" facs="tcp:24844:54"/>wee uſed not
their help herein as before; but his ordination was perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by our owne
Ministerie and Elderſhip without them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Claſſis aſſumed not then, any authority unto
themſelves over us, how comes it to paſſe, that they doe it now? Or how
will it hang together, that their power is ancient; and yet 20 or 30 yeares
paſt, they uſed it not. This to me ſeemes groſſe contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and
that hee eates his owne words, as Saturne did his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p>But I geſſe what hath cauſed him, to tell two contrary
tales; na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely, the difference of the people againſt whom hee hath writen.
The firſt were <hi>Separatists;</hi> and therefore no marvaile though
againſt them hee pleaded for <hi>a free Congregation:</hi> for hee well knew
that unleſſe hee went this way to worke; hee ſhould fall with diſhonour
in the controverſie between them. The other are <hi>the oppreſſed and
burthened members of the Engliſh Church in Amster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi> Now to keepe
theſe under their burden and oppreſſion, hee ſees that hee muſt let
goe his former hold; and on the contrary ſay, wee are <hi>not a free
Congregation, but ſtand under another Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall authoritie out of
our ſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus a good wit will ſerve a diſputant in good ſtead: for
by it (if hee liſt) hee can as the Poëts fable of their Proteus, turne
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into all ſhapes. Like him, who having made an excellent ſpeach
in the commendation of juſtice, afterwards ſpake as wittily to the
contrary: ſhewing that there was no juſtice at all in the world. Or like a
Gentleman, of whom I haue heard, that in an Aſſembly of States, ſuch as
wee call Parliaments, was abſolutely the beſt ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker; yet nothing
reſpected; and that for a moſt ſufficient reaſon; which was this: They
knew full well, hee could ſpeake as well, and as moovingly to that which was
quite contrary.</p>
               <p>And I willingly profeſſe, that <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Paget</hi> hath a
rare faculty this way, to turne a thing, which way hee will; and make it ſay,
either <hi>I</hi> or <hi>no,</hi> or both when hee pleaſeth.
Notwithſtanding this I muſt tell him, the very thing which hee ſpeakes
off, touching <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Robinſons Booke,</hi> is now true, concerning his owne
former writing: <hi>It is ſicke of King Iehorams incurable
deſeaſe,</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>the
guttes of it fall out day by day; Yea hee openlie pluckes out, ſome of
bowells thereof, with his owne hands.</hi>

               <p>There are ſome other objections, of the like nature, which hee
uſeth againſt us; partly to diſgrace our perſons; partly our cauſe;
<hi>as that wee doe not agree among our ſelves, touching the due power of the
Church: That the practiſe which wee ſtand for is Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme,
